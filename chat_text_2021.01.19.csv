6,R_1GCXs0KddP3VDig,"I think they are talking because the man in the hat is a PI who the man in the hooded shirt has hired. Yeah, too easy, I guess. Maybe we're cynical and they are friends out for lunch I think the spy from behind them makes his move on the unsuspecting pair. Yeah, smoking in a diner seems odd. I wonder if it's set in the past? I would feel incredibly safe as I'm with my PI. Hm, fair enough. I suppose people don't hire PI's for non secret information. I feel like the only thing I hear about them getting hired for is over cheating spouses. Haha, yeah, that. Exactly tat. that* Could be. I think they are students discussing a project. They are seemingly younger and the school-type chair in the middle throws it off for me. Whatever the case, everyone is super interested in the one speaking He is trying to establish dominance in the room, but failing miserably. I sort of wish they had faces The more I look at them the more it creeps me out There is definitely a semblance of distress. The amount of focus placed on the speaker points to an issue he has the answer for. Right. Ted is about to walk up and show him what's up."
6,R_3wJHGn9uugenvOx,"I think that the man with the pipe is a private investigator and the hooded man is telling him about something he wants him to investigate YESS we're so smart Hahaha probably, we have suspicious minds That guy behind them looks like he's spying on them I think the guy behind him will karate chop the PI Yeah, he looks like he's about to attack somebody Or maybe he's just going to ask the PI for a lighter It's gotta be, that PI is like a 1950's PI I guess I'd feel paranoid cause I'd be telling the PI about some secret stuff and would be wondering if we were followed Yeah like maybe his wife is cheating on him but her brother works locally and might pop into the bar and see him talking to the VERY noticeable PI HAHAHA  I think they're in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting I feel like the guy with the knee up is like comforting somebody This scene feels stressful to me Yeah true that guy on the couch is chillin Maybe he just thinks better when he's standing HAHA Nobody cares if you stand up, Ted Me too, I think Ted would be crying Yeah.. their little blank faces and nubby hands Well I'm still sensing distress, but I guess it's like you said, Ted tried to take a stand but nobody cares about his opinion Oh my god maybe they're about to arm wrestle Exactly It's a frat party"
7,R_3D74CajEZcUcIZm,"They are probably discussing their work day. Or could possibly be some sort of informal business meeting. True. or they may call over the waiter/bartender to order more drinks. I might be a little put-off by his attire, having a top-hat and smoking a pipe in this day and age seems alittle odd. or a group of friends planning an intervention. Noting the empty chair in the middle as if they are practicing something. or could be actors. probably because he just walked in on the situation. TRUE it might be a bit tense if they are planning an intervention. I agree."
7,R_3NxNmRfygjwFNmS,"Yea, they are probably talking about what they're did at work They might bring out some sort of papers to discuss about I would feel fine, probably a bit involved in the conversation with the other guy. That is very true, a bit anachronistic  They could be students talking about a project that they're working on, or employees doing the same True, or he could be the group leader or if they're practicing he could be the one evaluating them Very true They could all be very focused on what they're doing"
8,R_2Bg36ydXY3dH2QA,"what if they don't show? It definitely looks like a bar or even just a diner since it appears that is a coffee mug and a fountain machine next to them Where is this package that you see? I am pretty sure that is a soda fountain or something related to the restaurant  I think the man in the hat will get up and leave could be Why? because he has stuff do. I would feel relaxed and maybe entertained- depending on what we are talking about Yeah, it does seem like a nice laid back environment work or something work related yeah, the guy standing up seems the most tense True, and the other two sitting down have one legged kicked up maybe because he just joined the conversation? I agree and feel the same way Or else he is just listening and not talking? I think the mood is a little tense because they all seem to be really focused on the guy in the center yep, something is about to go down"
8,R_3poqNszF4mQrEqm,"They are discussing a package on the counter?  It looks like a bar of some sort. Question is. Is this a Hand-off, or does the package belong to the man with the stylish hat?  From the angle, it looks like they've been talking awhile. The boxes next to the guy with the pointed hat. Just up and the the right of the cup on the counter near the hooded guy's hand.  Could be. I think the hooded man will get up, shake hands and then depart. I'm thinking Irish coffee in those cups.  But then.. I think I need more coffee right now. This seems pretty laid back. There isn't anything I can see that says otherwise. It seems pleasant enough No chairs at this counter though. Probably further back in the restaurant / bar/ tavern Seems like a small gathering. The atmosphere feels a little more tense this time. The guy on the couch is laid back, but everyone else is either turned towards the speaker or hunched forwards. So it's a spirited something or other This is probably uncomfortable. I know I'd rather be standing when I'm just at the edge of a conversation, listening.  Intense. Not to 'heated' yet, but at least two members of this discussion 'give a damn' and it concerns everybody in the group. It's like watching one of those temperature gauges go down slowly as the barometric pressure falls. Storm weather is brewing. "
10,R_NUTrF1mxrP1mJLb,
10,R_1gU8gH0B7lklApz,maybe they are friends? or could be Father and Son They will talk to a waitress  To order more coffee Like I was being talked down to Planning something that involves all of them Because he is the leader given the body language it looks  relaxed
11,R_aW5AVKDVIMkqnkZ,"Greetings I think maybe they have something special to discuss that noone knows about I don't know it looks kinda shady lol I think someone will say either pay up or pay the price Ah your right they may both have something on one another...and what place these days allows you to smoke right at the counter...hmmmm Yeah it does right I mean and a pipe no less I would feel awful  He must have something on him for him to put up with that and the place must not be a well to do one to tolerate that open pipe smoking either I mean in your house is your business but out in the open at a diner is just wack lol I think they are in a meeting at work...they look like they are trying to come up with a plan to impress the boss lol Hes just observing them ...menacingly  In his mind hes like "" I don't care what they come up with noone is getting a raise""  He is the boss watching them struggle with idiot concepts over a job that doesn't pay them what they deserve anyway Can you tell I have been in that situation far too many times in my life? lol those group meetings are so dumb and the mood is tense for no reason  True...You must make it seem as though your paying attention and that you really care though"
11,R_2CPaHX1btp7vwC4,"hi they are talking as they enjoy themselves TRUE they might both pay as well its sounds awful to smoke right infront of the others i would really feel bad and suffocated TRUE TRUE thats true because the air is just filthy true.and he just seems okey with it they look like they are nursing one yeah,i got them wrong he seems to be the boss lol yeah. tense.bearing in mind they are working as the boss watches them"
12,R_12lPO4sCjq8Kxb1,"What do you think he is talking about? I thought it looked like soemthing from a mafia movie, like the man in the pipe is giving orders Yes you're right, I thought it was a bar but it's not.  I think they move to a table and order some food Either way he should stop, it is rude and there might be kids there I think I would feel hungry  and maybe a little bit annoyed that my dad (or whoever he is )is smoking in my face Maybe he is sitting at a table with his family, his daughter has asthma and he is getting into a fight with the man  I think they are the little containers you have sugars in at a diner i think these guys are sitting around talking about the news maybe I think they are talking about politics and the guy standing off to the left is shy and doesnt want to get involved Or maybe the black hair guy is a professor, and he is listening to a group of his students debate something Maybe he doesn't like them Yea maybe he is just a weirdo who walked past and is being nosy seems relaxed and friendly "
12,R_3HHRD3M3IxcI7I1,I think they look like father and son. mmmm maybe I was thinking it looked like they met for a coffee. I just think it seems casual the one in the sweatshirt seems pretty laid back. I think they may move to a table or possibly leave.  Not sure can smoke a pipe in most places. He better put that pipe down  Or it might be a smoking establoishment are those ashtrays on the bar I am now kinda thinking he might be telling the man with the pip to put it away like he is offended i just do not know if those are ashtrays  Oh maybe you might be right so I am going with hoodie guy is offended wow i am stumped but yes they could be discussing something currently in the news the one on the couch seems pretty relaxed so must not be an intense conversation and the other guy sitting pretty chill with his leg up He either just walked over or did not want to sit down wow that is good thought  the part about him being a professor or they could be talking about sports and that guy knows nothing about what they are talking about the mood seems pretty relaxed like i thought earlier they are sitting in relaxed positions even the guy standing seems pretty chill arms are relaxed positions with hands in pockets they could offer him that chair
13,R_3j8KHNGETrvpTmE,might talking about football match that day they order more drinks because of long chats I feel bored if I were the main in the hooded sweatshirt looks like a community gathering..maybe talking about how to secure the neighborhood because he wants to join in the conversation intense
13,R_NUTrF1mxrP1mJLb,I THING MANY MOMENTS
14,R_A5JxxArXb9isjMl,To be friendly The man in the sweatshirt will turn back to his coffee. I would feel fine... no idea
14,R_3GpurVb95pVVIiy,byh no idea no idea
15,R_2bNxPbj4SOLHahc,HELLO YES 
15,R_33qmXSc1nBh9xUy,BECAUSE OF HOODED SWEATSHIRT IS OUR NATURE  YES THE PEOPLE ARE CHATING  WITH OTHERS BLACK HAIR MAN STANDING THEY ARE DISCUSSED 
16,R_32LtShFxVvFPwk3, good 
16,R_do2vH7obEkWwx9f,"He could be a detective Hello? The man in the hooded sweatshirt will get arrested. He is in a defensive position and probably being interrogated. I would feel defensive and scared. They are talking about how to solve a business problem. He is the boss of the business. The mood seems a little tense, but the woman on the couch seems relaxed."
17,R_1nUSKUHWVBxFHXe,Drink specials or what they prefer to drink The weather What do they do for work One will laugh at the others joke Pleased with the conversation Enjoyed the company It's an improv class Work meeting Self improvement class He came late to the meeting He felt uncomfortable getting into the chair He has a leg cramp He's the teacher or monitor  Serious since they appear to be taking turns
17,R_1ITyQfAdBwKx30z, juice summer drink coffe yes speck some official yes discussion any project he came late to meeting he some pain very interesting matter discuss some important matter
19,R_efixyGbvwpbUpUt,"HI. Are they talking about the weather? Any other ideas? I think we need to have like 6 go around about what they are talking about Maybe the guy in the hoodie telling the guy smoking that it's not legal to do that If that was the case, the guy with the pipe willl  tell him to buzz off I am not sure. He's pretty brazen for smoking in a coffee shop If what we had discussed happened, if I were the guy in the hoodie, I would be pretty ticked huh? Let me guess. They are talking about the march they are attending on Saturday in support of immigrants Because he came to the meeting late masybe they needed his chair so they could right something down and didn't have a desk They are hopeful and excited to attend the rally and stick it to the Trump administration! you still there"
19,R_2ZJs726Su7ZOFEn,mm yeah no s corrct if that is case that man goes out they discuses about how that man will comes out  but do not know that will happen  yes oohh
20,R_Zyid1hCC3Gz0IkF,HELLO    
21,R_smOOAeZxXnkbcop,"I think it might be lunch time and they are breaking together. What do you think Where did you go? I think they will have to get back to work. I think they are at lunch and must return to work soon. What do you think I would feel like nervous thinking I have to go back to work soon. I would just be enjoying my brake, but the more I look at it I think the man with the pipe is intimidating the man in the hoodie. So I might feel scared. Also if anyone can see this I do not seem to have anyone to chat too I think they are talking about a sick person possibly and what their options are if any. He could be the head of house hold and be trying to tell everyone else about the bad news.  I also was thinking this could be like an intervention where they are confronting a person with a problem perhaps it is the man with black hairs son. He could be standing because the man sitting with his hand in a fist wants to hit him, but I am thinking against that one although the others could be telling him to calm down I think no matter what the room is tense. All of the things I named would be tense situations."
22,R_2490CtSPGC7G4vE,"Yes Or maybe they are people who have just met They will leave from there, because they have something to do Exactly, they only went through a cup of coffee"
22,R_2wBloIFksKEkH2J,"Maybe the one smoking the pipe is his grandpa and they are having breakfast at a diner The one in the sweatshirt maybe just went for a jog I dunno Yes, that could be true or he asked if the seat was taken If he asked if the seat was taken, the man with the pipe probably said something like ""nope it's all yours"" Yes if they know each other they will probably leave together Yeah they clearly don't have any food, so a quick meeting for coffee and then off to do whatever they are going to do for the day I'd probably feel caffeinated and happy to spend time with my friend/relative  oh no Do I keep talking even though my partner is gone? This looks like an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting so perhaps they are doing group therapy Maybe they are talking about why they drink or used to drink I think he probably got uncomfortable by whatever topic they were discussing and needed to stand to calm his nerves My partner left so I can't discuss but that's what I think I think it's probably tense, yet supportive. They all seem at ease with one another but not at ease with the topic being discussed It can be hard to talk about your own struggle but it can be so reassuring to find others that can empathize"
23,R_sjt0mqNWbkRgBnH,"looks like friends at a bar because they are friends that's a possibility yeah, but is that what they want us to think? maybe it's his grandfather I think they will have a drink  not sure, either way I think they will have a beverage yeah exactly who knows if it's a friendly conversation or not I want to think it's his grandfather and he wished his grandfather would stop smoking that cigar lol maybe they are having a meeting at work and talking about their boss lol could be and they are discussing the situation about him because they have been sitting waiting for a while and he needed to stand for a bit yeah those chairs were way too hard I think it's solemn because their relative is in the hospital or like I said earlier maybe it's a work meeting and they are venting about their boss it looks like the guy to the right is mad"
23,R_25AejDotr444Ost,"I think the guy in the hat is a private detective that the guy in the hood is hiring He has the classic private detective look with the pipe and the hat Possibly but they look like they would be weird friends if they are friends Maybe they are father and son I think the guy in the hat lays down his business card and walks out And then the guy in the hood stands studying the card for a moment before leaving He is deciding whether or not to hire this guy Do you think it is a bar or coffee shop? Looks like a diner of sorts I think they call the server over for the bill Depends on whether the guy in the hat is a private detective If he is and he tells the guy in the hood that he has found some information that he is being cheated on, I think I would feel depressed if I was the guy in the hood I know I would feel like the man should not be smoking a pipe in a diner haha...likely story Possibly....they also look like they could possibly be in a hospital waiting room with all the chairs Maybe this is a continuation and the man with the pipe had a heart attack and they are waiting for the doctor to come in with news on how he is doing Maybe he has a thing about sitting too close to people Maybe he forgot to put deodorant on that morning and needed to get up away from people. You are probably right though...His back probably is hurting because they have been sitting in those uncomfortable chairs for too long The look like the wooded ones which have no cushion It looks like a serious conversation. Maybe discussing a project plan  That is a very real possibilty."
24,R_1qTYr4l5K5RI7tY,I feel like maybe they are making some kind of deal
25,R_wTtl3GgUWGhPFsZ,They are talking about current events Good point Maybe his grandfather or someone like that? Ohhhh maybe a hitman! So now this next guy walks in and has a seat at the bar I wouldn't feel to comfortable at that bar....there's hardly any room with the coffee machine right there Definitely nervous....and hes eyeballing the guy who just walked in These folks could be discussing their weekend plans or having a philosophical debate I'm not sure....hopefully hes sitting He looks like hes maybe the mentor to the group and is observing their conversation  He looks like he could be a professor of some type Room looks kinda dull...maybe these folks dont know each other and are uncomfortable  Guy on the couch is definitely looks like hes from Dazed and Confused
25,R_3ilr0sE8PYOEccI,"It looks like they might know each other and happened to run into each other I wonder if the guy with the pipe could be his boss? Yeah, I was wondering that too He sort of looks like he could be asking him to do some kind of job Ha!  I really wasn't thinking of that, but it does look like that The guy with the hooded sweathshirt looks a little nervous to me Although the guy who just walked in doesn't look dangerous to me Looks like maybe they are discussing some kind of family problem? Is that guy in the middle standing or on his knees? The guy with the black hair looks like he's left out our an outsider Good point, I didn't think of that Yeah, I was going to say he looks like a teacher I kind of think the mood looks somber.  Except for the guy on the couch.  He looks pretty laid back To me, the guy in the middle has sort of a puzzled look"
26,R_2ANzGdCB443hKXl,because they are friends  one of them will order another drink im not sure if we need to keep chatting  wouldn't really have any feelings if i were the man in the hooded sweatshirt.   haha i would feel a little underdressed to be his friend  and why is this guy smoking a pipe inside  why are they gathered around an empty chair?  seriously.  he's like what is with these people and their rage towards this chair  awkward  agreed.  and then there is the other guy with his arm sprawled across the back of the chair like totally chill
26,R_1lhJR9t8h8OAhLz,"because they're both at the bar, that's what people do at the bar. Are we supposed to keep chatting  one of them goes to the bathroom... I thought I saw something about it in the long preamble about the study, but not sure. I would feel like I was at a bar, talking to some guy who is dressed up like dick tracy.  I would feel like I was in the wrong era. I am not sure I get the point of this survey. And why are they so angry at it? He thinks his friends are crazy talking to the chair? Hes coming up with an excuse to leave.  Uncomfortable. Two dudes yelling at a chair, another one watching, and the normal guy is standing back wondering how he got here.  Did you leave me here with this crazy survey? no come back!"
27,R_3OdAf1t7EFshUp7,Maybe they are working on a business deal? what do you think? I think that they will both get up and leave. They look like they are not there to hang out and enjoy themselves.  I think so too.  I think I would feel nervous.  It looks like they are having a support group meeting.  It also looks like a teachers lounge so maybe a breakroom setting talking about work.  Maybe he just walked in It might be he is moving from another part of the room to join the conversation. it seems very relaxed.  Looking at the body language it seems laid back
27,R_1F4x1K4b2Fg7fgk,Maybe they are working on a business deal? all right of business
28,R_3P6Id0dMdiQ5HPB,I think because they might know each other. I'm not sure though. Yeah that is a good one. Although it could be the other way around. The hat man is short.  He looks like a mob boss. I think that the hat man offers the hoodie guy too little money and they get into it. There are two of them.  I think they are body guards trying to hid ethemselves. Or maybe it could be a hit man audition. I think I might feel surrounded. Like something wasput in my coffee. I would feel like I was huffing a smokestack with the pipe in my face. Yes. They might be trying to audition for Pirates of the Carribean Part 8. Misspelled. Because the chair is broken. He just entered the room. Lol.   He's actually that midget from Game of Thromes standing on a stool. They are all discussing that Doritoes commercial he was in and worried how it will accect the show.
28,R_1mzxzVTf41PGAlI,"I think the hooded man is hiring the hat man, who is a hitman. The person closest is an undercover agent and overhears the whole thing.  I like the that too little money. I would feel nervous. The big game. After he slammed it down in a drunken rum-fueled rage as part of Will Turner's ghost It's probably relaxed."
29,R_1qTYr4l5K5RI7tY,"I think they’re making some kind of deal. The man with the pipe seems jmportant. That’s a good point Yeah, definitely a bar. Maybe they were both alone and just started talking. Maybe they will buy each other a round of drinks and continue talking. I would feel a little intimidated.. the man with the pipe is intriguing to me I think there is more to him Agreed for sure Yes you read my moind about the clothes. Mind* yeah I can see that with his his arms are placed He does seem to be observing I think they’re trying to come up with some kind of solution The body language of each person is different Some seems relaxed while others more intense Exactly. I don’t sense any tension really"
29,R_50jHwIgDnWDaiJj,I dont know.  It's a public place.  I think it's more of a friendly casual conversation.   given the ash trays and the smoking it's probably a bar or pub I think the conversation will continue The man in the hoodie seems relaxed and at ease I guess i already answered that question haha I agree.  I would feel a sense of respect a work project? they seem to be wearing nicer clothes and look intense He might be an outsider to the group of the other three a boss observing progress maybe I think it's intense but respectful yeah.  the two on the right are deeply engaged the bottom left looks like he's just along for the ride
30,R_3MMZaWow3OZjYrh,"They could be getting together to talk business Maybe they're waiting at the bar for their friend before moving to a table They could also be waiting for their wives or girlfriends to show up I think the guy on the left will pick up his coffee and throw it in the other guy's face for blowing smoke  Maybe the waitress will come over and take their food order yeah, if i was the hooded guy i would tell him to share his pipe with me but i would feel disrespected by the smoke being blown in my face. These people are planning a bank heist and a kidnapping, The're going to kidnap paul ryan from Bank of America while they rob it. thats why they're also talking politics he pulls all the strings and tells people what their roles are. i like the klingon theory too. i feel like the mood is very tense. everybody is probably unsure of whats going to actually go down and how it's going to happen exactly i was going to add that they can plan only so much"
30,R_1gMjyQLLLoUiktN,they are making small talk while waiting they may be on a date maybe they are arguing they will get another drink so as to get drunk then the guy will have to relight his pipe i would wanna some of what the other guy is smoking politics of course who they gonna kipnap after or before the heist paul ryan keeps his money at the fed reserve he is the head felon or he has klingons they are worried they may not get away with it wondering if they planned it enough yep the unexpected cannot be planned
31,R_3MMNbxDkW72L6hE,"I would think they are talking because they know each other, maybe because they are friends. If they are sitting in a diner together I would assume they know each other. It could also be something more exciting. In movies, tv shows etc. this type of situation would be about a covert mission, or someone trying to recruit someone to help them with a task. I think that one of the two men would walk away. I think I'm going to go with the movie idea, so after the man with the hat and pipe says what he came to say, then he will leave. Or if the man in the hoodie is unhappy or uncomfortable with the situation, then he will leave. Are you there? I would feel either excited or scared. I would feel excited if the man with the hat and pipe was giving me a unique opportunity. I would be scared if he was threatening me or offering something that sounded terrifying or difficult to do. What do you think? They could be talking about literally anything. Hello there I agree, news or weather. Without facial expressions it can be hard to guess. Maybe he just arrived or was about to leave. Yeah, that chair doesn't look comfortable. Maybe talking about the news got him excited and he felt like standing up. Yeah I agree. Again without facial expressions its hard to say."
31,R_3sahGr5XiQgUR0i,"hello probably about the latest news yes and drinking cofee yes you can tell alot about expressions he may not want to sit down right. he couldve just been passing and seem someone he knew  very friendly, they seem to be having good conversation"
32,R_TqjnFy6ClyPSeaZ,"They look like they're at a cafe and are making conversation about what's good to eat/drink there. Or, they may know one another. Maybe that as well. I think they'll sit together and sip their drinks and chat for a while. They seem to know one another as the man w/o the hat looks comfortable with his arm on the countertop. I think they will chat at a table for a while. I think I would be comfortable and enjoying what the man in the hat has to say. I think sports because they seem to be all men. Or maybe one is telling a funny story to the others yes one is gesturing with his hand He has just approached the group, or he is just about to leave. or he is a stranger overhearing the conversation agree easy going, chill, relaxed yes"
32,R_2CstOgvRJJww1ce,"dad talking to his son? although I do like your idesa.....maybe 60's gangster and hit man? almost think the boy is getting advice or instructions and will leave hst man is definitely there for a while no food, only coffee Ii probsbly learned something in the exchange, whether good or bad interesting there are no seats, only  standing I think sports may be a good thought cooking up a strategy is possible good observation is he a leader or question poser? that seat is rather close in for him to have been sitting in it no doubt there is an interest congenial but contemplative yes, no sense of stress, but all seem attentive"
33,R_b9hSzKGZOWA9Q7D,"Oh cool, a bar setting They know one another Likely, seeing the one man has hat on indoor Someone else will enter the picture maybe? Or yes, could be that Any place is a good place to find work I think it would be a great opportunity Since they don't grow on trees, i'm happy to be offered  They must be at an AA meeting and those are annonymous No telling what they are speaking about They look intense The empty chair is suspicious though Indeed! Why would he be supervising though with an empty chair right in the mix They are telling secrets Maybe they are playing charades and they are thinking what he is doing standing with his hands in pockets No kidding, awkward indeed He is 'playing' the sober guy at a party"
33,R_8q5DfBegRWN411L,"Yep Most likely business Probably one of those ""I've got a job for you"" scenarios I'd be content getting any leads Yep, a job is a job lol Probably supervising That, or he's thinking, what a bunch of loonies, talking to nobody No matter what, it's gonna be awkward Kind of like being the sober one when everyone else is wasted"
34,R_3oKDriuXiC8tRWw,they are making small talk yeah yup thats an interesting suggesion - i think thats right lol i would feel nervous yep you are very good they are having an intervention lol i think s o he doesnt want to be intervened lol tense yea
34,R_30jBMD3DDKSA6Hi,"The are facing each other. They appear to be looking at each other. They seem to have a casual stance. I suspect the man with a pipe is a bookie. He seems overdressed. I think the guy in the sweatshirt will place a bet with the bookie. lol What was your first thought? I think the guy in the sweatshirt feels nervous and pressured. He has a gambling addiction and knows he should say, ""NO"" but the bookie is making it sound so promising. Sweatshirt dude just can't walk away. lol thanks It's an intervention. Black haired dude won't sit. great minds think alike. lol He feels they are judging him. But it can't be too heated of a conversation because his hands are in his pockets. Dude on the far right is letting his emotions get the better of him. He's angry. He is actually laughing inside about how much dude on right is getting angry,  He probably just smoked a doobie, that's why he's so mellow even though it's an intervention. He wants it to be over because he has the munchies. it's mixed, a little tense. doobie smoking dude and girl on couch are relaxed. one in middle is interested, but one on right is very intense"
35,R_1mfalkRwoK62IZA,I think they are talking because they are having coffee next to each other at a diner I agree as the man with the pipe will leave I think if it is a cop interviewing someone that it is an inappropriate place to do so I wouldn't be nervous if I hadn't done anything wrong I actually work in law enforcement so I know how things really work Hard to tell if this is at a house or place of work or he's just tired of sitting that but he's still in a circle facing everyone so it looks like he is still part of whatever is going on yeah could be probably pretty tense agreed Or make it worse. lol 
35,R_5yDPd7gmRo5olOx,"It looks like a detective is at a diner interviewing a witness. Agree about the diner, but I think it is a dective. He has a hat smoking a pipe very Sherlock Holmes like. Could this be a place that the victim patronized? The man with the hat will leave when he is done questing the other guy. It almost looks like the figure behind is trying to listen to the conversation. Perhaps, the one guy is explaining that smoking is bad for your health. I would be nervous thinking that this guy is on to me. Don't you every watch crime shows, they want to make the suspect feel secure. I would still be intimidated even if I didn't do the crime. I think it is a work related chat. The furniture doesn't look too welcoming so I think it is work. It is all men maybe they are in a hospital waiting room. Perhaps a friend was injured in a football game. He is either taking a mental break or feels he isn't part of the group. Or maybe he doesn't like what they are discussing. Yes, I agree, but maybe he is annoyed with them. Tense  They need a female to settle the dispute. Could be."
36,R_2sZtWkPWN4UJ9SX,"Hello.  What do you think? That's what I was thinking.  The man with the pipe is trying to hire the man in the hooded shirt to do something. You might be right...pipe guy might be detective and hooded sweatshirt guy is trying to hire him. What do you think happens next?  Do they both leave?  Does he pay him? I agree, he will give the pipe guy an envelope full of cash and a picture of his cheating wife. 10% up front?  The rest when the job is done. I would probably feel nervous. Maybe feels excitement knowing that he is doing something wrong. Could be based on their postures.  Looks like they just watched a fight, or are going to watch one soon. Perhaps an MMA match since that is more popular these days. I think so, also, he is waiting for the buffalo wings to be ready and is going in the kitchen to get them. Gotta have wings with your UFC Everyone is excited and can't wait for the main event.  Maybe they have already seen the fight and are just discussing it now...probably smack talking too :-)"
36,R_2pSRQW8nTUfonYV,"Looks like they are making some type of deal or plan.  I was thinking the other way around. They will probably exchange money because it looks like they are making some sort of arrangement.  He will probably give him a percentage of payment. He is a shady character so probably feel fine  Yes, some people are like that. Looks like they are discussing a boxing match!  I agree. I like UFC He is observing the discussion. That’s funny BBQ! Seems like they are happy because their posture seems relaxed. Some smack talking too."
37,R_3CVCkQLYOr334U0,"Something shady MAybe he wants him to do a hit on someone And where are they, he should not be smoking indoors I thouhgt maybe a diner But could be a bar I think that money will exchange hands Yeah me to I think that u are right. Maybe the police will come and arrest someone. I would be really nervous I would be waiting for something bad to happen. Or maybe the person to my right. was a spy or going to hurt me Looks like a self help meeting Or maybe an intervention IS the guy standing up nervous and pacing or did he just arrive? Yeah I could see that. he is nervous or he just arrived. Yeah that could be it He is waiting for something  I think that there is a nervous vibe Worried even Hello Did you really leave?"
37,R_1oH15JvRhFQ2PrB,"I agree, seems shady. it looks supicious It could be, the hitman is the one in the hat It seems like a bar to me It could be a diner, I just thought the smoking indoors was more likely at a bar I think the man in the hoodie will slide the hitman some cash. Maybe he'll just slide it along the counter in an envelope. Because it does look awfully suspicious, this exchange. If I was the man in the hoodie I would be nervous. And paranoid I would think the waitress was an undercover agent Yeah, what is the guy to the right doing there. I think they are discussing a family member who was hurt in a hospital waiting room Though, an intervention does seem plausible too I think maybe he is the nervous parent Because he is nervous they are about to confront his drug addicted child Yeah, he is def not looking forward to whatever will happen next I think it is a sad vibe, a little hopeful, but scared also"
38,R_2490CtSPGC7G4vE,"probably yes Yes, or maybe you do not want to be recognized there It may be possible because you do not want to be recognized Everyone after the deal leaves Maybe, and that's why they are in a public place, so as not to attract so much attention me too! I would feel nervous and impatient"
38,R_dmVoh0YkWhWpRhT,"The man with the pipe looks like a detective Perhaps they are both cops? HMm True, maybe they are drug dealers? I think maybe they will commit some kind of crime together? As my partner says, they do not want to be recognized.. True, I like your thinking Oh, weird. Perhaps I'd feel clever? How about you/ ?* Fair enough. :0 Impatient, I can agree with that. I think they are probably in some kind of therapy session. Perhaps it is family counseling of some kind? I imagine them talking about problems they have in their family. I wonder if they are married and it is their sun standing off to the side, it appears to be a man and a woman sitting with a therapist on the left. The man with black hair is the son of the couple on the right, I think. He is distant because of the problems being discussed. His hands are in his pockets and he is standing across the room, but is still looking on, interested.                    Oops! I think the mood in the room is tense. The people in the room are explaining difficulties with each other to the therapist on the left. The son is distant, hands in pockets, looking on. I think the parents are calm though."
39,R_3LhcZxjxFRqXXeb,"Hi!  Looks like people are at a coffee shop or a bar.  Probably a bar since they are smoking I think so too They aren't dressed alike so probably don't work together I agree I imagine one will either leave or offer the other a light.  I see a lot of ashtrays around Are you still there?  It says you were disconnected I might feel a little inferior to the man in the suit and hat.  He's probably got a better job and is wealthier than the man in the hooded sweatshirt Or he could be asking the man not to blow smoke in his face,  He might feel a little angry  at the man for being rude I htink they are talking about therapy or a medical procedure.  It looks like the two people standing are dressed in uniforms maybe hospital attire Maybe they are getting ready for an intervention.  There is an empty chair in the middle and people facing it He doesn't seem to be apart of the main conversation.  He seems disconnected to the group.  Maybe he feels inferior to the core group that is discussing things. If this is a hospital setting he may be a lower staff member or a trainee It looks like its a serious mood.  Maybe a somber discussion about someone they love or the plan of action for a patient.   I think there is something heavy that is on their minds.  "
39,R_1lAHuwWHBxqLcNi,I think they are just making conversation at the bar I would say that they probably aren't too close of friends or anything like that if I had to guess
40,R_2atWJ3UzZfdVylE,"I think they're planning something nefarious -- a heist of some sort. I think that the guy in the sweatshirt will carry out something shady, like a hit.  (Obviously, I watch too many television crime dramas) I agree! Perhaps the bar is a shady bar where only scheming criminals hang out! If I were the guy in the sweatshirt, I'd feel cool and confident.  This is more challenging. They could be talking about politics, but they could also be members of a book club or something.  I can go with that. They're all very engaged with each other.  I think that he just arrived and is entering the conversation.  But it could be the teacher or group leader, too.  Me too! Oh, the days of the student union. Anyway, it looks like they're having a great time engaging with each other. I agree -- ! Very involved and intense, but in a good way.  Cool! Agreed. "
40,R_1OoWFN4KRC8NfvK,"Because they are politely talking to each other to pass time. that could be, but wouldn't they meet somewhere more private? let's go with that fr our answer then. i love a good crime drama. I would feel calm and relaxed. I never thought of that. that sounds correct. they are doing a group project for college. the teacher is watching the group. that makes me think of when I was in college. Let's go with that I like that. That's exactly right. time to move on."
41,R_UnhFcPE66U0GiwF,"Hello! Well, it seems they're in a bar, because the guy is smoking But there's a coffee cup on the bar  It's nearly possible to ascertain what they could be talking about or what could happen next. I guess the finish talking and then go into the men's room to engage in casual friendly intercourse. That's my guess. NEXT yeah well it could be anything Indeed I'd feel very excited and ready I guess. I'd pull up my hoody and close my eyes senator. This is for the good of the nation. It's just called being patriotic. They're having a discussion about Kierkegaard. He's like this philosopher from the 1800's I don't think he ever chased the dragon though The man with the black hair is just trying to get the time for the love of god! I imagine this must be some really useful data for them. Awkward. Definitely awkward. I mean, the guy on the right is clearly giving a handjob to a ghost which is really strange, and dude with the black hair is like, wtf guys?"
41,R_3LdMPgL521yekgo,"Hello! I'm not too sure what the picture is asking but I assume it means talking about? that's true. there is an ashtray on the counter too. maybe an old diner i think one will order something. maybe what do you think? LMFAO! that is a pretty specific guess ah i see you are a man of culture true. who know's he could just start blowing him right there. right! i mean I'm not gay or anything but a glory hole is a gloryhole and it's great to bust a nut ""I did not bareback the man in the hat"" oh that guy probably has an addiction to sucking dick for heroin and the guy with the black hair just walked in like wtf i just need the time what is kierkegarrd Bullshit. I'm not buying that hey i hear everyone back in the 1800s chased some things it's like the server doesn't even pay attention to the conversation! gosh Absolutely. I doubt anyone else is presenting this well Yeah but guy in the black hair is ready to throw a chair. He's sick of the danish philosopher shit He just needs the time so he knows if he kids game is over so he doesn't run into his bitch of an ex wife"
42,R_1eFg8YZjbKGieyC,"They like each other and are attracted to each other. Hello are you there? the man with hood will probably walk away as there is smoke in his face. I would feel like he is in my personal space. Too close for comfort. Seems like a friendship gathering to me and their probably talking about recent events happening in their daily lives. the guy with black hair seems comfortable just where he is as he has a vantage point and able to observe all that is happening. He seems very at ease. The mood seems easygoing, relaxed and friendly, and everyone is paying attention. Why because of their body language."
42,R_32VEatCDf7sJ7Fu,"I think it's a matter of business what they talk about they will shake hands and go  a little tense of a project to deliver at the university I think he's tired of sitting I get the feeling that it is a harmonious and interesting conversation, the body positions show this"
43,R_1nW40iwqyImppwZ,It looks like they are catching up on things The man in the hat looks like an elder to the other man They are meeting to drink after work The men drank a beer and caught up on things What other place do you think they went to after the discussion? Possibly a game Ok.  If I was the man in the sweatshirt I would be relaxed and engaged The man in the hat looks like an older business man and the guy in the sweatshirt looks like his son or nephew. They are talking about being alcoholics It looks like an AA meeting where they are discussing issues together The man just arrived or is moderating the discussion with the others. He looks like he is taking in the discussion Agreed The discussion looks heavy The mood seems heavy Agreed.  They mood is very somber
43,R_10x9Icf9fsVYdbT,"They talk about some important things i think they are moved to some other places after the discussion yes, they discussed about something important The man is look like a big businessman or drug dealer anything may be its true, but i think they are not relation the picture said, something important discussion is going on,new one is arrived on gang how did you said they are alcoholic partner? he just stand and listen conversation The conversion is heavy,the serious mood is surrounded yes partner"
44,R_0AmqXZIT2RrIOAN,"they look like they are in a bar or a diner so they might be strangers that have just met and started talking one man is smoking a pipe so it may be a smoking bar the figures seem to be male so... more credence to a smoking bar they may be friends or coworkers that decided to kick back here the mug betrays the idea that this is a bar... perhaps it's a 1950s diner this may be an old-time scene where men are discussing work and waiting for their lunch the next thing to happen may be food is served? could still be a bar, given the railing bar food is a possibility the bar may also serve coffee maybe it's a shakedown the 2 don't seem comparably dressed the man in the hat might be a mobster the guy in the hooded sweatshirt looks like he's leaning back a bit he might be nervous maybe he's trying to think of a way out they seem to be strategizing about something 2 are leaning in looking intense dark haired one might be an instructor or it might be someone who isn't keen on the plan could be a student debate discussing a book ideas philosophy person on couch is relaxed he could be the instructor of a class or he might have needed to stretch his legs because he disagrees with the intense men could be another student might be someone that was part of a scheme but now is having second thoughts dressed similar to others, could be a peer it seems intense and yet most of the group (if not all) are on the same page there's possible debate going on might be a bit of tension with the dark haired man or the dark haired man could be a casual observer (instructor) allowing debate to continue the fourth man is relaxed enough that it seems manageable"
45,R_1F8mdZZmDBSGwVM,"hello you know why that are talking? I am doing good. What about you? I think they are talking because they are facing each other. I think that the men in the picture will order food because I don't see any food on counter. yeah I believe it  what about you. I would feel pretty talkative if I were the man in the hooded sweatshirt. the question asked what we think happen next they already asked for coffee   I think they are reminiscing  why you think that? I don't think the man in black is comfortable with the other people what do you think? I don't think so  because the man in black and one of the men is facing each other because his hair is black okay, I think the mood is pretty bad because one of the man is raising is fist lol what about you? what do you think? okay I gotta go have a fun day"
45,R_PusAGNzLE9oTh85,"how are you good morning Do you believe that? and as I see, they asked for coffee apparently they observe something the specific topic by the way they all look towards one direction how do you know it is black sure debate a strong theme"
46,R_2uKSKzRCjNOLlZH,"I think they are co-workers. You think the man with the pipe is the father? Yeah after they are done talking. I think I would be ready to leave It looks like they are sewing or fixing something. They are observing what's going on. That could be true. Everyone looks pretty relaxed, yet focused"
46,R_1d5AwCIMnSuPyIC,"i think the man in the sweatshirt may be relatives? maybe a son and father? they could be co-workers yeah, he appears to be dressed more like an older gentleman i think they may go their separate ways? they don't look to be close, if you are meeting someone in a coffee shop is usually for a quick get together if i was the man in the sweatshirt, i think i would be happy after meeting and talking to my dad since i have not seen him in a while this looks like co-workers meeting. they may be talking about business? he may be the new guy in the group and is trying to pay attention. he had to stand up after sitting for so long the mood looks to be one of concern or attentiveness for whatever the guys sitting is describing"
48,R_12lPO4sCjq8Kxb1,"I think they are talking about family issues Or maybe they are talking about the news and politics Is anyone there? I think they will continue to talk for a few minutes.  And then maybe take a walk I wonder if they know each other i would feel happy that I am with my friend/family member I would feel a little annoyed that he is smoking in my face I would also probably feel warm, because I have this hoodie on inside.  They are talking about a class assignment The professor is watching them debate about a topic He is in charge that is why he is standing up He is listening to the debate and providing feedback in regards to the topics discussed in class earlier in the day I think the mood is scholarly, I think the student on the couch is very relaxed, the other ones are a little more serious I think the mood overall is positive though"
49,R_3smHlYXDgyeyYCn,"I think that the guy with the hat is trying to interrogate the guy with the hoodie. I agree. Maybe the guy with the hat is a private detective hired by the guy with the hoodie. I think that the guy with the hoodie will leave after getting to talk with the detective. Or I think that they are both going to leave the coffee shop in order to get working on the investigation. If I was getting interrogated by the detective, I would feel really nervous and full of anxiety. I think that the people in the photo are part of a theatre club. I think that they are planning who is going to get each role, and how they are going to perform their respective roles. I think that he is standing because he is about to rehearse his lines. I also think that he is waiting for instructions on how to perform. Yes, I think that the guy in front of the chair is the leader. I think that the mood in the room is serious, since they are trying their best to put up a play. "
49,R_3PaxDg5iEqwebTH,"I think the man with the pipe might be a detective. The guy in the hoodie is either being interrogated or seeking his services. I think the man with the pipe will go and seek out additional information from what the guy in the hoodie told him. I think they're already relaying information, and it might make more sense for the detective to dig up dirt on his own then get back to the guy in the hoodie at a later time. I would feel anxious, too, but if I were seeking detective help, I would probably feel at ease knowing the task was in good hands. I agree. They seem to be rehearsing.  I agree with that. I think he's just waiting for his cue to partake. I think he's listening to what the man sitting down is saying before he performs any action. I think the mood is light and fun, but they're getting down to business. The man on the couch seems pretty lax."
50,R_1LGuBYKSSmuYncu,business partners? Hi could be friends thats all i see you? are ya still there? they continue talking? they get up and leave? maybe asking directions? I think I'd feel like its time to go I wonder whats in his pipe? lol any more thoughts? me too they are talking about work? maybe about where to buy a pipe is that a computer screen? kinda looks like one hes bored lol could sit on the couch theres room next to that person tired of sitting they look like they are serious to me must be important they should get a pipe lighten up bye
50,R_28HBiaI2wQG4OMS,"yes hello yeah sure yeah i think so. sorry im just looking at the picture i think the man in the hood is asking to someone  yeah i think so after they talk they leave  yeah lol your curious huh i think i feel comfortable taking to someone using pipe talking i mean i think they are talking about whats going on right now in thier lives maybe too lol im not sure i think the man is standing because no more chair lol its already occupied  lol yeah maybe he just like to stand yeah yeah they are serious talking  yeah, hahaha to relax"
51,R_sZRozAKtKR79t5L,"Sexual innuendo Possibly, but they are dressed different The man with the pipe is older The man with the pipe will offer the young man money for sex The man with his back turned appears to be much younder Younger Sitting in a suggestive position I would feel violated. Disgusted. How often do you get offered money for sex ata coffee shop? It's a coffee shop in Greenich Village circa 1980 A school board meeting? I just thought that too ""Hello. my name is, I am an alcoholic"" Hi Yes. The tragic mistakes theyve made up until now He's insecure Hes not sure if he's comitted to the group Could be his first meeting....and his last Badly Intense! Apprehension, fear of saying the wrong thing ""Im tired of hearing about your pity pot!"" And never come back"
51,R_3lW7bAyL6v0qDek,"They know each other maybe it's a business meeting. or a detective  I think the man with the pipe will leave because he was just there to get some information about a business transaction. Yea he does look younger. I think he's leaning back because of the smoke.  I would feel uncomfortable.  The look like they're in a AA meeting. They're going around the room telling their drunk stories.  He's standing because he can't stand the guy who's talking.  Yea, he wants to leave. He wants a drink. annoyed eager to leave They all want the meeting to be over. "
52,R_1GPtcUXWTH1uDwt,"Hi, whar do you think is going on? but they are facing each other directly. I think it is a more serious meeting. maybe a business deal gone wrong? and what is on the bar by the man with the pipe? two boxes? Any ideas what will happen next? My guess is the man in the sweatshirt leaves because he is angry/scared yes I think I would feel scared and/or intimidated. Do you agree? definitely I think they are colleagues talkig about their job. Or it could be an intervention haha Let's go with an intervention Clearly the woman was sitting in that chair before she got up Maybe because he got frustrated? But I don't think he was the subject of the intervention. I think it is tense That chair is so close the man in the right."
52,R_3qWfNET8ETHuoCW,"well, they're at tha bar so maybe one offered to buy the other a drink? it seems like a casual meet up, what are you thinking? perhaps. they definiitely seem to know each other  so, do we agree the men are at a bar discussing a business meeting gone wrong? what do you think happens next? maybe they part seperate ways? or the man throws the boxes at the other ok so we agree they part seperate ways after the meeting at the bar.  if i was the man in the sweatshirt i think id be on edge. it doesnt seem like happy conversation.  yes, i agree. i think the guy with the pipe is more "" in charge"" any day now lol  seems kind of like an intervention of sort? they seem very relaxed but really involved in their conversatoin lol! so an intervention  yes, she probably didnt like what she heard.  i think the man got upset and didnt like wht the other people were saying to him so he got up yeah, they seeem to be looking more at the man with his arm on his knee. maybe he kind of wanteed to get away from the conversation yes, very tense.  looks like the other guy is resting his foot on it"
53,R_1pMbilLGsSU8afP,Hello Are you there Yes The restaurant is not a place for smoking I think I think the man smoking will go out or put off the smoke Yes I think so Or tell him to leave I am not sure but I will feel bad because it's a public place and not everyone likes to smoke or want to be qssociasso with such Where is this place? Any idea
53,R_9tnXdy9ugCRHUu5,"hi,they are probably  talking about qhy he's smoking in a restaurant  what do you think? do you think tbe next thing is maybe someone asks him to pu it out? i agree  exactly  i would be a little upset wouldn't you? yeah but i would be upset i had to say something not someone at a he restaurant  this is a weird one, i have no clue, looks like he's talking to empty chair  maybe he's pretending what he'll say to someone A1PBFDQR599N3K maybe suggestions  anyone thete? tense, not sure what is going on"
54,R_u4SyiaqJIjrl4hb,"The man with the pipe is a detective gathering information What do you think? The detective will head back out to his car and try to figure out how the new information he obtained fits in with the old information What do you think of the picture? I'd feel like I have to recall the information in my memory to the best I can Yes He's dressed like a detective  It's a group of friends having a casual conversation at one of their homes They're talking about their plans for an upcoming baseball game What do you think they're talking about? He's a huge baseball fan, when he gets into conversations about his favorite topic he can't sit down Fairly casual with a light air of anticipation, they can't wait for the day they go to the game What do you think partner?"
54,R_ZCeL0yvINDjJnMZ,the detective is asking him some things to get information  yes yes It's a group of friends having a casual conversation at one of their homes  is listening You are done! You can continue to the next page. Chatter R_u4SyiaqJIjrl4hb has disconnected
55,R_4GYMnyWa8pAz89b,I think the man with the pipe is a detective interviewing a patron at a bar. What do you think? It could also be just two friends speaking with eachother. After the picture I think the man with the pipe will go away while the man in the hoodie continues to drink. I would feel as if I were being interviewed by a detective. I'd be a bit uneasy afterward. I think the people in this picture are talking about an event. The man with the black hair looks like he's looking at a sign that everyone else is staring at. The man with the black hair is standing because he just recently left the room and is returning. Or he's reading the sign everyone else is looking at. I think the mood in the room is lively. Everyone seems engaged in conversation and relaxed in tone. They're also wearing similar clothing so I think they might be part of a group.
56,R_1oHYEKNa2lYkaJk,"I think they are business men  By the way the man with the hat is dressed it looks serious  I think the man with the hat will leave  A little intimidated  Sporting event He might be the host  Exciting, tense over the game "
56,R_RRKVKIBQsrqMtWx,"asking some personal questions yep,I think that is corect both are discuss some business plans and they are leave. likely serious Talking about sports I think he was student seriously discuss to the Event"
57,R_a2EWjixBDOuUQTv, YES TRUE YES VERY CLOSE FRIEND VERY COOL HMM COOOLLL DRINKS OK I WIL ACCEPT can only see one of them with a cup  Feel in this situation if you were the man in the hooded sweatshirt YES they are just having a friendly conversation ok chaetter
57,R_2ZU28gnNRYGJNbz,"Wow, that's pretty vague. They could be talking about anything Their body language mostly looks friendly though But the guy with the pipe looks like a gangster haha Hmm they could be talking about the food there at this restaurant, or maybe who is going to pay the check Makes sense! I can only see one of them with a cup so it definitely makes sense that the other may get one Sounds good I would feel comfortable I would think, he looks like he's just chatting with the guy with the pipe. That they are just having a friendly conversation. Definitely Looks like they are maybe at a meeting of some sort with them all gathered around Maybe a work meeting? Talking about a new project they are working on? Looks like he's just calmly listening to the man in the right corner talking Maybe his chair was uncomfortable? It seems serious to me. Like the man in the right corner (with his arm up) is really serious and emphasizing what he's saying with his hand.  It seems all attention is on him as well"
58,R_z28iHGthxTMf4Zz,"they will continue talking, because they enjoy talking to each other I would feel good about talking to the other person. They might be talking about a project they are woking on at work He just arrived and is listening to find out what they are talking about. They look like they are in agreement  and are happy with the outcome."
59,R_eLnLBeCzDEdytEZ,"I think they are talking about a possible crime investigation  The guy with the pipe is the investigator and the guy with the hoodie is being questioned or is a suspect I think that they guy with the pipe is going to go on his way to investigate a case  because the guy in the hoodie gave him a clue or a hint I would feel intimidated by the guy with the pipe I would also feel puzzled  They are talking about possible ways to market a new ad campaign The man with the black hair is standing because he is the one pitching new ideas I think that it is tense, because the man with the black hair is trying to see if the other people like the ideas"
60,R_1Ihk2RdS9uQRHNS,"I think there could be several reasons They could be father/son or they could have just sat next to each other at the bar and apparently now I have nobody to talk to which will certainly make this more difficult I'd like to get the money out of this, so I suppose I'll keep talking to nobody It doesn't look particularly dynamic, so I would think they'd mostly just continue to sit there talking I don't know where this is, but I can't think of anyplace currently that would allow someone to smoke a pipe indoors, so it's quite possible one of the diner staff would ask the guy in the hat to put out his pipe I think I'd be pretty comfortable He looks fairly relaxed in his posture Although I might be reading things that aren't actually there, since it's a step up from stick figures I might be jealous of the other guy's hat, though It kind of looks like an intervention. The standing guy looks like he could be defensive the chair is crowded in the middle, so I can see him wanted to stand up and back out for some space It appears the person on the right is currently talking, though He looks defensive to me and has taken a stance to back away and maintain a protective space around himself the spacial reasoning of this picture doesn't make sense - is the chair slid under a coffee table? I think it's uncomfortable They consider what the person on the right's saying to be important, but they don't like that it has to be said. Maybe it's like talking to yourself in a chatroom, except for the important part I wish there were some instructions on what to do if your partner leaves"
60,R_3ltp27y9srNFEro,Maybe they are friends?
61,R_rpVRImtndN7B6md,Because they are next to each other and both desire conversation Basically to break boredom They will keep talking  possibly buy each other a drink Honestly I would ask the guy how he can get away with smoking a pipe in a bar I would wonder if he owned it  I would also think I was underdressed Some discussion possibly a bank heist or small robbery or a spot to go on vacation He is tired of sitting He is tentatively listening but nervous to ask for the seat too timid to ask for the seat Probably tentative towards theone on the right seated quiet The one on the right because of his lean seems dominant
62,R_bvzmJ91SuWIE8al,waiting for the his man saw a wanted person hello went to outside are you there? discussed something his person with servent four peoples are talking some secrets i think that man is servent very silent and scary situation thank you
63,R_2SqbdxSskUh6E2T,They are talking about work I think the man with his back to us will finish his drink because he has a cup beside him in the picture. I would feel relaxed. The man in the sweatshirt looks relaxed and comfortable. I think these people are discussing problems that they are having. He wanted to have some space.Mayb   I think the mood is relaxed. They all look comfortable with each other.
63,R_2w5EUBiIVFruoF5,"I believe they are talking; otherwise, they won't face each other. You maybe right.  They may talk about their work. The man with the pipe will turn around because a man is coming to the restaurant. I will be alert and switch the focus on the man coming to the restaurant. They are talking about the result of World Cup. He just came in and joined the meeting. All of us should be relax."
64,R_1OlfVENG7y9mfLR,hello? ok....
65,R_zdJUn9uuZ3NArlf,"they are looking at each other. they are close to each other. hello? hurray! They will get the coffee they ordered.  It looks like a coffee bar. hello? I would be happy. there are a lot of ash trays on the bar They appear to be talking to an empty chair. The chair must have done something wrong, or its a role playing game They are talking about the chair as if it were a person. the man with black hair is not taking part in the role playing.  he is an observer or possibly a coach. hello ? That is tough to read.   two people appear to have their legs up on the chair being talked at. they alos are leaning forward and gesturing. that is tense."
66,R_3h61MEU8Vyp5Jid,"hello!  Looks to me like a chat in a pub probaly a work issue? or sports? I think sports I agree! we'll go with that okay? lol I wish there was a timer here I think they will both laugh.  LOL I like taht - another round! laugh and another round. so now we wait out 2 minutes so where are you? minnesota here and even more mosquitos! I think the man in the sweatshirt might be annoyed by the stinky pipe. I like that thinking 'damn, that pipe stinks and he talks a lot. LOL! the empty chair seance? hahahaha! tLOL! Good!   I like it! lmao! works for me! well, DUH!  because the spirit is sitting in the chair okay...LOL! me, too.  Thanks! We're great! Well, I think the spirit they are talking to hid some money and is refusing to tell them where it is because Carol for got the board! that Carol....so irresonsible! this guy on the right is raising his fist threatening to punch the spirit in the face if he can find his face See you! Thanks!"
66,R_1OpgHPTedRrmvaT,"Hi. yeah I agree. Probably just killing time talking at a bar  eh i think they were strangers before this meeting so probably sports more than work  ok so that is settled lol  yep  right same i was just wondering  oh ok  they will order another round maybe ok sounds good to me  order another round and then laugh about it yeah totally  cleveland  you? land of a 1000 lakes!  lol!  ok if i were the man in the hooded sweathshirt i would think ""ok this guy talks a lot but whatever I like observing people""  oh yeah i was thinking that oo  too  this pipe stinks and this guy talks a lot  but he's buying so i dont care!  yeah haha  oooh dark!  i dig it though  damnit carol you forgot the ouijia board?!?! dear spirits move this chair up into the air if you wish carol would have brought a ouijia board and made this easier for everyone  ok lol great!  he's a nonbeliver!  this isnt going to work, you guys!  oh yeah!!!  let's go with that  really funny  glad we are making this go fast  we're a good team  somber? tense? nervous? excited? kinda a combo?  hahaha damnit carol!  so tense and frustrated!  who shows up to a seance without the board?! hahah!  it was nice working with you! enjoy this 4 dollars "
67,R_3MMDynDI5DPa5sD,"Maybe the man in the sweatshirt is asking him to stop smoking. They could be. Ha ha That's a very good possibillity. It doesn't look like he's sitting. And he wants to be away from the smoke. Yes, especially in an enclosed area. It looks like they might be having an intervention with the man. Yeah, that seems more like a realistic idea. He could be contemplating the idea they came up with. Ha ha Yeah, I agree. It looks a little awkwrd. awkward"
67,R_PBeio8mQTOTXdJL,"I think they are acquaintances. I like yours better. :) I think the man in the sweatshirt will take his coffee and walk away. To answer the why portion, because his coffee is ready. I don't know. Yes. Exactly. haha I think I'd want to get away from the smoke ASAP. Agreed. I think they're brainstorming an idea. He does look defensive - an intervention may be what's happening. I first read that as invention. oop oops It looks a bit tense, like not everyone is on the same page. Agreed"
68,R_b1LXRqAdBZvWUGl,"Casual conversation in a bar.  That is possible. Yeah, I think it's a diner.  Or planning something. This is possible. lol They will pay then leave. Then go do whatever they talked about. Yes, I agree That is what I thought. Many places are smoke free these days.  Maybe relieved that they had a discussion of their plans. Yes, he is at ease The other guy looks like a gangster though  Someone out of the 1940s lol very much so Yes, because they look intense.  Yes, a counseling session. And the guy in the middle is a counselor perhaps. AA or NA An observer perhaps Yes, maybe perplexed Right Definitely not at ease  TRUE Or somber Definitely not light hearted I think so"
68,R_10YRUIOZl8Odkme,"I think they are talking about politics A bar or maybe a diner Looks like a coffee cup They could even be talking about the weather. TRUE a trip or a crime lol I think they're going to pay and leave Because they are facing each other and look like they're about to get up Maybe they have to leave because the one with the pipe isn't allowed to smoke indoors And they're going to do what they planned like you said Yes. True I think I would feel comfortable His body language looks relaxed Yes. Defintitely A little bit. Especially with the hat TRUE Old school lol They're talking about a problem Something serious Maybe it's an intervention Yeah...the guy on the right has some sort of problem What do you think the problem is He's the father and feels uncomfortable in the situation He doesn't know what to say He's more of an observer than a participant right now Yeah, he has to take a mental break He's pretty upset Yeah, his body language is clear Not at ease He has things he wants to say but just doesn't know how It's tense Yes!  Because of what we discussed- the conversation is a therapy or intervention and the body language suggests something very serious This is not a party Hello"
69,R_1EhTVpo5tzDeWnL,"They met at the bar and fell into casual conversation. Maybe they're in Alaska. We visited there recently and I was surprised smoking was allowed in bars. Or maybe they're in Europe. I wondered if this was a coffee shop instead of a bar.  I don't really think the two of them are together. They are dressed so differeintly. I would want the man in the hat to put out that pipe! Yeah, he probably is interesting. Not many people wear hats these days. Are they practicing for an intervention? (Waiting for someone to occupy that chair?) The dark-haired man looks hesitant to get involved. Yeah. He's not so sure he wants to sit down and hear what the others have to say. That would be tense! I would say tense, except the person on the sofa with her back to us (Mom?) is in a pretty relaxed position. So maybe that person isn't mom, but someone who has less of a vested interest. All the men definitely look tense."
69,R_2YDF7IUPMMj942C,"Yes, casual conversation or... They could be discussing how lucky they are smoking is still allowed where they live inside. but casual conversation is more likely.  That's shocking.  Smoking hasn't been allowed in bars here for a long time.   Seems to me that they will probably get food next.  Looks like coffee is already on the table.  Certainly looks that way.  Maybe a casual cafe? Another option is that they could be finishing up and waiting for the check. Yeah, I agree with that.  Certianly wouldn't enjoy the pipe smoke.   Looking at body position, I think I would also feel interested in what the other man was saying.  Enjoying the conversation (minus the pipe) maybe?  Not many people still smoke pipes either!  This looks like a family meeting to me.  That could certianly be it!  Maybe family therapy.  The dark haired man is maybe the one who the intervention is being held for... Maybe two of the others are his parents and the found out he was using drugs. Definitely the mood in the room is tense.  Dark haired man upset that he was caught and parents disappointed in his behavior.  Also, the fist the other man is making seems like it adds to the tense atmosphere.  Maybe mom is just letting dad take the lead in this situation?"
71,R_1pMbilLGsSU8afP,Hi Where you same person I previously chatted with? Ok I think the man in the hooded sweatshirt is asking the man to turn of the smoke because it's a restaurant
71,R_2zihdBE07ajUXVl,yo Nope.  First time I've done this. So are they planning to rob a bank? A hot lady comes up to them and asks the man with the pipe if he would like to buy her a drink hello? I would probably tell him to put out his pipe because this is a non-smoking facility and tell the lady I would buy her a drink instead politics
73,R_3HHPUFKmrErawZU,"I think they are engaged in friendly banter discussing the intricacies of their daily routine and the motivation that propels them, giving them the motivation to be successful in their daily endeavors.  I think they order another round of java"
74,R_1JJdg9vUl8scZbu,"I think they are probably just killing time chatting. It looks like a bar from the 1980s. There are ashtrays! It could be a father/son chat. The guy with the pipe is dressed like he's older. I think you're right. They aren't at a good spot for chatting. The beer dispenser, or coffee maker, is right there. I'm thinking father/son chat. Pipe smokers are always dads. ;) Yep. I was going to say happy. They look like they are relaxing after coming in from the cold.  Probably a long day at work, trek through the cold to the bar, and now it's time to relax. Now I'm kind of envying them, as I sit at my computer. It looks like a hospital waiting room. We'll go with the class discussion. They look pretty animated for a hospital. Maybe some assignment where the professor said they had to work together. Let's make them medical students! He looks a little left out. That sounds good. He's about to come up with some brilliant observation. The one with his/her back to us, looks like he's waiting to see what he says. I think so too. After a long night, they have it all figured out.  The standing up guy looks ready to leave. Arrow to go to next page!"
74,R_2dWKTtkqgWuwwey,Same...it looks like they are just having friendly conversation until the other drink comes You could be right. I thought it was a coffeeshop at first. They might go and find a place to sit to keep talking Right...maybe they are waiting on the other drink to come before they sit Comfortable and relaxed TRUE Sounds right It looks like a class discussion But you also could be right....the one standing close to the table reminds me of a doctor for some reason He does. But maybe he's also pacing because they're studying together and he's trying to remember Right That one looks the most relaxed of them all They actually seem pretty relaxed Like maybe they're winding down the studying Because they think they know it Right
75,R_pNaHziG6EclHGlH,hello
76,R_1DC4sNa4B5UzQRy,"Maybe they are planning a heist Second look, it's a coffee shop and not a bar.  Maybe ? now what? The man in the hat will tamp out his pipe and get up to leave They will have concluded their business anyone there? nope just me hellooooooooo the guy in the hoodie is an infamous hit man  Nothing was discussed I am alon e talking to myself the guy in the had it a wealthy older man and the hoodie is a gold digger hoodie is closing that deal planning his next trip to europe to visit his real boo anyone there yet? The people in the picture are in a book club they are discussing the Harry Potter Series They also just took the online test to see which house they would be in Greg is really upset he's not in Griffindor He is very involved in discussing his Ron Weasley fan fiction  He can't deal with Greg anymore so he needed to pace Greg is so Slitheryn I think the mood is very tense in the room considering my discussion."
78,R_3iqx9hrVaHTTEvs,"They are coworkers. Maybe one is a undercover cop and the other is a detectie Agree, and then the guy with the sweatshirt a few minutes after. I would be guarded about being observed. yes confident also that we were about to make an arrest. yes, the doctor in the waiting room delivering news guy on the right appears to be upset. he seems like he is taking in the news, kind of resigned, and yes nervous. the mood is probably kind of somber  yes hoping for some good news."
78,R_2ahirQl0V8hzOLY,"I think they’re discussing a big case, maybe they’re detectives I think the guy with the pipe will walk out first sgreed  id Feel confident my partner and I are making moves to arrest someone  Probably why he has his back to the door, good eye  They seem like they are at a hospital getting bad news Exactly. One of the men looks stressed Pacing, trying not to get upset or nervous Yes, taking in the news but he’s not the main family member so he’s backed off a bit Very somber, maybe a little hope  Wondering if they’ll be able to visit soon"

81,R_2rSMqfpBTL6Htnf,Cup of coffee Probably chit chatting Because they are friends
82,R_qw66GuGsrtLlJy9,being social they know each other They will stop talking and order food the man in the sweatshirt will ask the man with the pipe to stop smoking I would be annoyed that the other man was smoking in public. I would be anxious to eat. How their boss was being rude How the project could be completed He wants to join the conversation but is shy He is there to tell them break is over I think it is jovial as they are friends they are being productive
82,R_2wjACGmUi3tpRVD,They are exchanging pleasantries at the diner. they work together or live down the street from one another the man in the sweatshirt will leave  the man with the pipe will go to the restroom feel good that I am having conversation with someone I too would be annoyed by that My back would hurt from sitting like that How their day was. General small talk in the break room at work What their plans are for the holiday weekend He is anxious He prefers standing so he can observe. He is the new employee Relaxed and social They are having a good time on break

86,R_8qvEBpKdw13d9Bv,Hello
87,R_8uDkvFEcK9XlTpf,Hello partner.  Or they could just be talking while waiting for their coffee in a coffee shop. I like the no smoking answer lol I know. Not wnough information I think they will leave together Or they could forget to tip the waitress and she runs after them lol I don't think they look like they'd do that lol. Would be funny to watch I would feel relaxed. He looks relaxed in the picture Maybe the guy in the hat is a homeless person asking for money.  I agree. The smoke would be annoying. Tobacco smoke isn't as bad a s cigar smoke though This looks like students or a work team doing something They person on the couch looks bored Maybe in a library? The person on the right looks like he's the leader He just arrives and hasn't taken a seat yet lol. Or they are planning the party The man directly to the subject is not sitting in a chair either Not enough chairs for everyone.  I think you're right It's a serious conversation I get the feeling they all know each other.  It also looks like there is something on the table they are looking at
87,R_1o5qOYAeNc33CJL,it looks like they are talking about something important as they are turned towards each otehr hi or he can be asking him to stop smoking really it could be anythign lol sports daily goings on not info info agreed maybe they ll order food lol or another cup of coffee go for a walk together and just talk maybe they r friends because they forgot to pay lol or he was telling him there is no smoking lets go outside and they forgot to pay waitress chases em lol funny if i was the hooded sweathshirt guy id be annoyed as i hate the smell of pipe tobacco and smoke blowing in my face while i drink coffee cuz im ex smoker of 18 years lol does look relaxed maybe the person at end of counter is staring at them too it must have something to do with the smoke ugh cigar smoke worse looks like a discussion on something deep or philosophical they all look relaxed yes it does look like studetns lol could be politics....ugh study group yeah the one on the right looks like leader no beers cant be a aperty lol looks like an office or library maybe he just came in or he needed to strecth lol he could be the teacher or therapist or leader etc mood seem discussional....philosophical quiet or maybe man has problem they all lsitening....so listening ya agreed ya
88,R_1gvIzBaupqjNp7P,How long am I supposed to wait? It's been 18 minutes....  30 minutes. 
89,R_2wG3NcJgCOLwv1E,"I think they’re talking about their day Oh why, sorry. I agree they’re talking because they are friends"
89,R_2rSMqfpBTL6Htnf,"Because they are friends, and met for a cup of coffee. I did the same thing last time X3. Thought it said what "
90,R_3G9fw69jZNdaVJU,"Hello, I think the picture depicts a good conversation  The man with the pipe looks like an investigator The man with the pipe left his contact information for the man in the sweatshirt to call him if he remembers anything else about what he is investigating. Depending on why he is being questioned. I would feel relaxed or nervous at the same time. This definitely seems like a surprise to the guy in the sweatshirt. He looks to casual for the situation if the meeting was mutual. The people are talking about things going on in their lives. Their are sharing experiences concerning the same topic possibly. I think the mood in the room is positive. Everyone is engaged with each other and relaxed at the same time. "
92,R_2wG3NcJgCOLwv1E,"I think they’re talking because they’re friends and met for coffee They could be talking about business The guy with a hat could be a loan shark or monster or something  Mobster not monster I think the guy with the hoodie will be worried because he can’t come up with the money that he owes the guy with the hat If it’s a mobster, I’d probably be worried  Me too It’s an addict meeting and they’re talking about how the guy with black hair never sits down It does kind of look like a business meeting and the black hair guy is presenting or something good call, looks like the others are already talking and he just arrived Probably  Because the black hair guy was late I think it’s probably pretty tense Agreed"
92,R_2YkT6u5VDbkRBcd,I think they are talking some buisness At least they're having coffee like you mentioned I think they will finish talking their business and go on their way home Good point Same here Id be looking for a way out and get some help They're talking about some business stuff that happened in the day I think he just got to the meeting I assume the others started without him Yeah black hair guy was late The other's probably are upset
94,R_2BtDSdJybW4Ra2A,They are getting to no each other What makes you think that I think they have a cup of coffee and then order breakfast I would feel a little tense talking to a stranger I agree. It does seem to be a bar setting. I thought it was a diner in the beginning lol It looks they are having a group chat in a rehab facility Thanks! Yes I agree. Exactly! I think that is what the others are saying to him. I think the mood is calm and inviting because they seem open for discussion. Yes I agree
94,R_2zihdBE07ajUXVl,"The are discussing plans to rob a bank The guy with the pipe seems like a mob boss and is devious.  The guy in the hoodie looks suspicious lol I think a hot lady comes up to them and asks them to order a drink.  The guy in the sweatshirt tells the man with the pipe to put the smoke out because this is a non-smoking facility.   after that, if I were the guy in the sweatshirt, I'd tell the lady I'd buy her a drink instead and tell the guy in the hat to get out of here because I'm not robbing a bank.  I'm just here to have fun. Hey.  Nice one.  It really does look like that! I couldn't think of anything lol He's a new guy to rehab and they're welcoming him to the group ""Have a seat in that chair"" Hopeful.  They're discussing each others' faults and past experiences but helping each other out with encouragement. Yep.  I think both of ours are awesome"
96,R_3MGXOX1yuCcAv18,It looks like the man in the pipe is an older gentleman talking to a younger guy Probably telling him about how things used to be in the good old days 
97,R_3EKZyimQpsOzBWB,"Perhaps they are friends or acquiantances? I have no idea. Maybe one leaves because they have something else to attend to. I think that he would feel fine. It's hard to say without knowing how well they know each other or what they are talking about. Yes, perhaps they are discussing business Maybe he's nervous and has to depart soon It seems a bit tense. I say this because of how close everyone is, and how locked in and focused they seem"
97,R_5iGn0DBPwGuUHq9,Yes! it looks like they are friends I think they might have a couple of drinks & leave I'm sure. I hope both of them would leave Quite a bit I do accept this. No clue.. May be about business. Looks like he's leaving apart Its typical. They looks like business people discussing something 
98,R_21cZaGk2gUPmpdw, hello?
99,R_2zhCewtEA7291aS,"I think they're making idle conversation Yeah, agreed One of them might get the bartender's attention to order another drink I would feel like I was talking to an interesting older dude about random stuff and learning a few new things it probably does, although not definitely. Just my impression, not objective fact. They look like they might be in some kind of uniform. I think perhaps this might be a work discussion. it does appear that perhaps he arrived after the others did and preferred to stand The mood seems very active, interested, collaborative Probably some sharing of ideas going around"
99,R_1hAaB03Z40Ky83W,"I think they just happened to be sitting at the bar together and are talking about the weather, sports, etc. I agree, just idle conversation. Since they are dressed completely differently, I don't think that they came together. I think they will each turn back toward the bar and begin eating or drinking. That's possible.  To me that looks like a coffee cup by one of them.  I don't know if the machine is a beer tap or a coffee machine.  No where around here can you smoke a pipe and eat or drink, so I'm just not sure what kind of place they are in. I think I would feel comfortable and content. Umm.  I'm not sure how you are determining ages other than the fact that one is dressed more formally than the other one. I'm not sure that more casual means younger. My first impression was that they might be discussing something at work.  I can't really tell if they are inside or outside. Not sure why one person looks much more relaxed than the others. I think he just walked up after the discussion had already started. He's interested. The mood in the room seems calm and interested.  No one is in an aggressive posture.  There may be discussion of the pros and cons, but no one is upset. Umm.  My chatter disconnected.  What does this mean for me?"
100,R_3I5XKqw88qhtPwW,I think the guy smoking is his grandfather what do you think? ? I think the guy will ask the younger one a favor because the younger guy is a runner like doing criminal activities for the guy smoking the pipe I would feel very nervous about the task being asked since it deals with criminal activity there is no other person talking with me about these pictures though they disconnected so i am just talking to myself there is no one dialoguing with me. They are in a hospital where their mother is  she had a heart attack and is in critical condition he has been pacing the floor with worry he doesn't feel like sitting. I think the mood is somber and tense. They are worried about the outcome of the health of their mother and are also sad.
102,R_3mfVxz6yBYJCRXE,"So, where are these people?  A diner, right? OH, maybe that's exactly it! Hoodie person is not thrilled with smoking guy. I see what looks like a coffee cup, but I also now notice ashtrays.   Maybe smoking is fine? OH, and they are standing, not sitting.   This is a coffee shop? Oh, now different question.    And the pipe smoking man is asking advice on what to get. And whether the coffee is any good He asks him what kind of tobacco it is, because it smells kind of fruity. {grin} Telling him the best coffee to get And what to avoid. (This is interesting) Ah, how would I feel.   Well, fine? Somewhat smug that I am being asked for my fine coffee opinions? Tired of the smoke in my face. I would quite probably try asking the smoking person if he could not smoke inside. Although clearly it is allowed. (Those have to be ashtrays, right?) Yes, almost all places I know of are like that these days. Oh, here we are looking at... a computer monitor? What is that? They look like they are in... a meeting?   Some sort of heated or very animated discussion is happening, so they are talking about whatever is on that screen. I think it's a monitor. They are discussing stock market results, as the figures change in real time on the screen It must be going well by the look of them Person on the couch looks relaxed, so their stocks must be doing really well HAHAHA.  He is standing because his chair turned into a monitor. It really is a chair, and the leg is broken, and the guy in front is trying to fix it? He is mildly upset, from the look of the hands in his pockets. This is so hard without facial expressions. He is standing because he has back pain and it feels better to stand a while. Oh, yeah, he just came into the room, where they are already looking at stock market prices.   He's grumpy, though. Or sad. OK, so we already kind of touched on this.   At first I thought they looked sort of heated or annoyed. Then kind of excited, like they were watching stock market prices. Or a sports event. Ups and downs, kind of thing? Like, the one on the couch looks totally mellow, but the one in front of the chair/monitor (heh) seems so active. Seems like their moods are different. I wonder if we're supposed to click the arrow button.   Mine just came on.    That hasn't been six questions yet, has it? OH."
102,R_2V7uMe7xwyhhbqZ,"They're talking about smoking inside a restaurant Oh, wait. Maybe that is a bar. Maybe hoodie person does not like the other guy's hat. Good observation. Maybe this is in a European country. I think hoodie will take a sip of coffee next. That's a good one. And hoodie guy is trying to see the smoking guy through a haze of smoke so, next, is that the smoke clears and hoodie guy answers his question lol If I was the man in the hoodie top, I would probably drink up and then leave Yeah. I would need a breath of fresh air In the U.S., there are even bars that have banned smoking. You have to smoke outside. Here is a new pic Is that a monitor, or is that the back of a chair? I can't even guess what they're talking about. Your guess sounds just fine. Sounds good to me. They could be gossiping about their wives, for all I know. I can't think of any response at all. Maybe he is standing because he is tired of sitting. Maybe he just now walked into the room It is just some men discussing something. What mood? Right. Very likely."
103,R_3EumSDSCq10zgTv, I think they are meeting each other in a restaurant or a bar. I think they’re introducing themselves to each other.  I think they are just making small talk.   Maybe the man with the hat is trying to sell him something. I think the man with the hoodie won’t be interested and will get up from his chair and move somewhere else   They just look like two totally different people there trust totally differently so I don’t think the man with the hoodie will be interested.   I would feel intimidated and scared and uncomfortable.   I would also be turned off by the smoking   This looks like a hospital waiting room. I think the doctor is discussing how his surgery went.   The man with the black hair looks like a family member that was maybe sitting for way too long waiting for the doctor to come out to give them an update so he’s just standing to stretch his legs.   Maybe he was afraid to hear what the results were so maybe he wanted to STAN farther away from the doctor.  *stand   The mood in the room is tense but at least one of the family members is speaking very closely with the doctor so they’re listening closely. 
104,R_3MGXOX1yuCcAv18,Looks like they are having an intense conversation
104,R_1g7wme4FIH3pgsT,"because they stare at each other's faces they will continue talking, and taking something order something to eat"
105,R_2sSen2ANw2KbdV6,Hello
106,R_10qQINgA6Rxi4zv, GOOD FOR MY SAME YES FOR THIS IT SEEMS A BUSINESS MEETING WHAT THEY ARE DOING A BUSINESS AND THEN CONCRET IT IF I AM ALSO PERCEIVED I WOULD FEEL NORMAL SINCE I SEE THAT THEY ARE NOT DISCUSSING IF IT IS AN INTERVENTION IT IS THE ONE THAT ANALYZES THE SITUATION IF FOR THE THEME YOU ARE TRYING
106,R_pNaHziG6EclHGlH,"Why do you think they are talking? To me, it looks like a pretty sketchy conversation  Are you there? Yes, I am sure that money is a topic in the meeting To be honest, I would feel a little strange talking to a man that is so casually smoking a pipe in a restaurant  Must be a different time period It looks like the person in the back is watching them too, so I am not sure how i would feel about that The people in this picture are talking to the guy  on the right about his drug usage  It appears to be an intervention  What else could it be? I think is the therapist or the person in charge of organizing this intervention If you have anything to add, that would be great Yeah. That is what I was thinking I am guessing there is a very somber mood in the room right now"
107,R_1JEku21xGtJDJXs,"  my opinion The hoodie was born of modest origins. Champion Products, which began as the Knickerbocker Knitting Company in 1919, claims to have made the first hooded sweatshirt. Originally a sweater mill, Champion began making sweatshirts in the early 1930s once it developed methods to sew thicker underwear material The hooded sweatshirt was first produced in the United States starting in the 1930s. The modern clothing style was first produced by Champion in the 1930s and marketed to laborers working in freezing temperatures in upstate New York. The term hoodie entered popular usage in the 1990s. First, it's made of heavyweight cotton. Most other sweatshirts on the market today are made of some kind of blend, usually cotton and polyester. The cheaper the sweatshirt, the more polyester. (American Apparel's hoodie, which sells for $46, is 50 percent polyester.) happy project discussion"
107,R_1jlDR1NbmAJ0LJf,"The two men are facing eachother squarely, so they may know eachother well.  I think they are talking about the man in the sweatshirt, who has recently had a baby. I think the men will finish their conversation and leave the store.   I think I would feel comforatable.  He looks very relaxed.  That's interesting, but how do you think the man feels?  How do you think you would feel if you were him?  I think these people are on a team together at work and are discussing a project.  I think he recently approached the group, perhaps he is the manager of all the people sitting and walked up to get an update.  I think the mood is really concentrated.  It lookks like everyone is working hard together. "
108,R_3PAgSxZWpluIyQZ,"To me the man in the hat lookl like a detective, maybe he is asking him questions.  What do you think? Hmm, those are two good options, maybe we can combine them his grandfather is a detective So if they are family and talking at teh diner, maybe the next thing is they will order breakfast and get a table Why do you think they might do that? Maybe they meet regilarly at the diner for breakfast, every week or so? Well, I would feel happy to see my grandfather and chat with him. I also hope he tell me about an exciting case he is working on  yes, I agree I also probably like him if I meet my grandfather regularly,  hmm, it looks like an office maybe? Yes, maybe a big project they are working on together? OK, sounds good We had a coworker who liked to stand in meetings to keep himself more engaged that's a good point, he has his hands in pockets, and looks relaxed not engaged Let's go woith your idea and say he is observing rather than participating realxed and upbeat they seem animated and engaged the person onthe couch has their arm out, relaxed yes! and I think the why is becasue of their posture even the two who are sitting are gesturing thanks!"
108,R_333ZB3efvTu2ilF,"That is very Iikely! I also think the man with the pipe may be the man in the  hoods grandfather.  He does look like a detective.  Yes, I could see that happening.  I think thats possible. That might be how they keep in touch. I would feel happy, at ease.  It would probably be something I would look forward to doing, if it is a weekly occurrence.  They look like they might work together, so they could be talking about that.  Yes like an office setting.  The way they are posing makes it look like they are engaged in the conversation so a big project fits.  He looks like he is observing the conversation instead of really joining in.  Ahh, that makes a lot of sense.  Alright sounds good  I thinks its relaxed.  Yes, upbeat. Its like they are excited about what they are discussing.  Yes, leaning forward and using their hands "
109,R_1ONz8y2QtRgryO9,"Hi there have you arrived in  Ok so I think we are supposed to figure this out (re discussion going on) any ideas I was sort of leaning towards younger man, older man, perhaps father son? Ah, great idea Ok so either father son or professor/student sit down together to have a meal> Agree, and if father/son or  prof/student with a bit of deferance agree ok so we are on the same page here seems like the man standing and the man sitting nearest to the blinds are listening to the sitting man on the right as it appears to be an institutional setting it could be work, school or perhaps medical? you could well be right everyone seems relaxed so I would think more a scholl setting I think he is listening in vs joining in the conversation oops we thought the same at the same time (lol) well at least we know neither of us is bot! I agree with your earlier assumption that this is intense converstation but also think everyone is comfortable once again full agreement the why I think is because everyone knows one another"
109,R_z8vrAaGrOn7BkM9,"Yes It is hard to say.  The guy with the pipe looks pretty intense and the man in the sweatshirt is very laid back.  I assume just casual conversation...small talk. Could be.  So, in answer to the second question, I think they will get their food soon, and have a meal together. Assuming it could be his father, then I guess he would feel comfortable talking to the man. He is turned towards him and making eye contact, so he must know him and feel comfortable talking to him. TRUE I think so. Yes.  He is using a lot of hand gestures.  Maybe telling a story. He is just listening to the man on the right. Agree Great minds think alike. TRUE It appears all 3 of them are listening to the man on the right talk. The mood is casual.  Everyone is listening to the man on the right talk. Good. I agree since they are all sitting close to each other."
110,R_1dozPJB5o71bMUf,"My thought is they are talking about what the man with the pipe does for a living.  He seems interesting Yes, I agree it does.  One of those great old lunch counters that are hard to find nowadays. I think both the man with the pipe and the hooded sweatshirt will be served their lunch.  They will likely continue to talk through their meal.   I agree, he seems to be intrigued with the man with the pipe. Maybe the man with the pipe has an interesting job and is recruiting the hooded sweatshirt guy. If I were hooded sweatshirt, I'd be happy to have someone interesting to talk to at lunch and I'd be very curious about who and what the man with the pipe is.  "
110,R_e4KlnY5IXZRNBol,It looks like a diner. What do you think? It does look like the man whose back is turned is interested.  That I should possible. I wonder if they know each other. Could be. What kind of work do you think he does? The man with the pipe looks well dressed. I think they are talking about a political issue Or maybe the stock market What do you think? He just joined the discussion I think the mood is serious because of their postures
111,R_3HSy2LikS5qx9Ko,They're bored in a coffee shop? Or perhaps it's an interveiw? Yeah it could be a number of things I think probably the grandfather will give him money But tell him to keep his grades up or something Or order some french toast and milkshakes me too I had some this morning I think I would feel pretty damn good I get french toast and money Grandpa is a swell guy Guess they aren't in Europe The people are talking about E3 basically a video game event where they announce all the games coming out I was the youngest so I had none of that although we were triplets It is aha I think playstation is dominating Everyone else is racist That is much nicer or he's a nursew it's too early for this hit. Maybe he just arrived It seems happy I guess. They're all close except for ostracized black hair guy Maybe they're all focused on ignoring him He does. He's a social butterfly Mine too! 
111,R_2Se7iPAHblvLecj,"I think that the man with the pipe has stopped in for his morning coffee and the hoodie is his grandson The grandson stopped to say hi on his way to work. Because he know that grandpa will be there.  Maybe he is asking him for money.\ Yep, I agree, and then they will hug. Or hoodie will show grandpa how to use his smart phone to text grandma I'm going to go with french toast. Now I'm hungery Me too, I can always use a little more cash Oh yea I forgot about the french toast that grandpa is buying me. But they will have to eat it to go because grandpa got us kicked out for smoking in public. Grandpas are almost better than grandmas. Grandmas feed us but don't give us money The are sitting around a waiting room in a hospital What is E3 Looks like a picture I have of my dad in the maternity waiting room when my baby brother was born. Your idea of E3 is much more current. I think that he is restless. Doesn't like to sit for very long. Or the artist ran out of ink in his pen. Could color in the other's hair. Maybe he is annoyed with the guy on the right for doing all the talking and not letting any one else contribute. Guy on the couch looks like he has checked out of the conversation I think the mood is focused man on the right has everyone attention  The guy standing would be my husband. He is a pacer. In all situations\ I think a couple of them are board out of their minds. One is self absorbed. And the other is just taking it all ine"
112,R_2tzIUNo7spq7vSR,They are friends and talking about things in general I would be interested in hearing what the guy has to say about the business.  He is preparing to address the group about his concerns  The room is tense because the group is trying to figure out how to raise money for the town.
112,R_3nT8DnuynFppJjX,they are discussing about pipe business. They are speaking about that business get a profit They are preparing the address and discuss in the group conference
113,R_26foQwHx00mxGLM,"a drug deal possibly a business deal what do you think it is then ? maybe a combination of this and the purchasing of cocaine for that brazil legend maradona great work he looks pretty white to me i think they'll get up and go to the bathroom from all that coffee of the two who doesn't wash his hands? TRUE can't really wash the nicotene stains away anyway I would feel good now that I've sampled the goods TRUE this is a gay coffee bar yes maybe he is propositioning for an older gentlemen sports the others seem interested the guy on the couch is thinking this is amateur hour or he has no pants on. can't tell he also could be sharing about a rock paper scissors match in which he won using a rock why is he standing, there is an open chair he seems inpatient, like we're all adults, hurry up with this story sexual frustration or tension where's the elephant yeah it's really big  fun chatting"
113,R_3n71CNV9LCe80Sn,dang you went deep real quick  Dude's are just having a cup of coffee and talking about the world cup. LOL  Or possibly a drug deal  bingo!  That guy in the back looks real shady  hahaha regardless of race.  he is up to no good that's a possibility  they'll also sample the cocaine while in the restroom  the pipe smoking guy won't wash his hands  depends on how good or bad the cocaine is/was it could be laced with a date rape drug  and now I don't know where I am and I'm going to drain my bank account  the guy on the right is showing the others how to give a blowjob or sports very interested  rock paper scissors is a good one.  maybe he has to pee really bad but doesn't want to miss the rest of the rock paper scissors story LOL... elephant in the room.  the tension in the room is the elephant it's huge 
114,R_296NDnjbgIfAkVA,hi there About their day maybe How are you for me it is more a morning coffe before going to work because i think this is not a particular place for investigations maybe it is winter maybe in a little pressure if it is an investigation and he is keeping on the counter maybe for their plans of a crime haha maybe but one is more the boss of the group maybe he has to answer the boss questions i think so i think with a lot of tension and quiet also other two peoples are with face down or the other guy missing
114,R_XQSNxYGlL0bXMPL,Hello They are talking about investigating someone. Don't you think?  Hooded shirt and gum shoe? gumshoe look you know  :)  Same here The hooded guy looks on the edge  :) Cooperate meeting I think Google-like Casual  About to go take a leak? Maybe you are right.  Yeah a little tensed  Sort of thinking  Maybe next plan of action
115,R_3EYiswiqLNoDC6u,"HI OH,YES SORRY,I'M NOT DRINK YES"
115,R_Uabvykf9HK2bgfT,I think they are just making small talk. Maybe they just met up after work and decided to get drinks together? I think they might each go home shortly now that they have had time to unwind. Maybe they will decide to order food too. I would feel comfortable.  There seems to be no threats in this situation. I would probably feel pretty relaxed if I was the man in the hooded sweatshirt. I believe they are discussing something medical.  Like possibly a medical problem Or maybe they are talking about a business decision? Maybe he is just joining the group? Maybe he is upset and needs to move around to be more calm Maybe he just enjoys standing  Maybe my chat partner is no longer part of this conversation and was never really part of it I think it might be tense because it looks like a serious discussion. It might be even sad if it is a medical situaion It does not look happy or relaxed of course there are no facial expressions on these faces so that is hard to tell for sure.
116,R_2TMmezNyzTNdrOq,"I think the man in the hooded sweatshirt may be asking the man with the pipe to do a job for him.  Possibly something illegal. I think they will finish their coffee, pay, and then head their separate ways. They are discussing their game plan. I feel that the one sitting down is the one speaking to all of them. He isn't in the mood to sit because he has been sitting all day. It also helps him to feel more in control towering over everyone. It seems to be a serious, somber discussion."
116,R_1gGvk3RA4WANCdu,"Seems reasonable, especially with the way they are dressed. They didn't order anything but coffee, and they kept their coats/hats on which means they are not planing on staying long.  I believe both men will get up and leave and go their separate ways and never speak again, (expect for maybe confirmation of completing the work).  That would depend on what the man with the cigar asked of the man in the sweatshirt. If it was something illegal, then I would most likely feel panicked and worried about getting caught.   It looks like they are at a hospital, maybe the man standing up is the doctor and they are receiving news about their loved one. He could have just walked over temporally, and doesn't want to sit and stay for a long period of time.  It could go either ways. If it was a hospital, the mood could be sad and tense, if they are just hanging out the mood could be relaxed.  "
117,R_1rMIq5xS7jsJy6j,"I think that they are related, possible father and son any suggestions on this question? I think the two men will get their coffee and go sit together at a table.  It appears to me that they are together"
118,R_1MRIZ7yL7I5Ah1r,I think they're likely talking about coffee.
120,R_1F943QGNnMu3Rua,Maybe they are talking about their day.  Or the man smoking the pipe can be an private investigator. Yea I think they are meeting up so he can tell him what he found out  I think they will have drinnks and then leave because he has all of the answers he needs  I would be nervous about what I would be about to find out When they are going to have their next meeting  Maybe they are talking about having a rally  I think he just walked in the meeting  That could be true and he probably just finished speaking  It look like it could be relaxed because the way everyone is sitting no one has a defensive posture Yes and the other two are leaning in 
120,R_abzAR273hKkS4Ip,"I think they are talking about running an illegal business it looks sketchy thats true, maybe this is about an investigation maybe it is a long lost relative I think they will walk outside and go in different directions because this is now a comfortable situaton or maybe they will go meet another one of his detective friends in a secret hideout I would feel stand offish, and I would not trust this person. discussing how to defuse customer complaints he looks like the manager who is overseeing this discussion ya I agree I think the mood is relaxed and non confrontational The one person has his arm laid across the couch with ease I think it is relaxed because everyone is getting a point across in a friendly manner"
121,R_3e3xqKv0ABhZMfn,They just met and are small talking I agree they will shake hands and go their separate ways That sounds about right I would feel excited to go investigate They are discussing a task or project I agree he just walked up on the group to listen It seems like they are in the early phase of discussing so they are all giving ideas because of their demeanor TRUE
121,R_1mdZ8r5IiQMTo9Y,"It looks like the man in the hoodie is really interested in the conversation. I think they will leave together to investigate something. It looks like a scene from a crime TV series. I would feel nervous. That is very likely. Or it could be sports. But they look more like they are planning something. The other guys are discussing the project and he is just listening. Oh, I tought they were outside on a porch. The energy is high and getting higher because they aren't tired yet."
122,R_1MRIZ7yL7I5Ah1r,"I think they're probably talking about their day. Or perhaps what the weather is like outside. What are your thoughts? Yes, they definitely are. Do you think they're talking about the coffee? I think they will likely get up to leave to go to work or home. What do you think ? I think I'd enjoy drinking my morning coffee and talking with the man in the hoodie. I think they're talking about a work meeting.  I agree, I does look like a support group as well.  I think he probably feels more comfortable standing then sitting. And, yes, to talk to and lead the group. I think they mood is probably one of sadness and anger because it appears they are having a serious talk."
122,R_3G9rR9gASXtOaZL,"I think they're having morning coffee one seems to go to work and the other one to his house to change after jogging tired by exercise Yes, it's possible, but it also looks like a support group He is the person who leads the group they seem interested and paying attention to a story"
123,R_2a8h8n4JBAkj8pt,Hello?
124,R_1rMIq5xS7jsJy6j,"I think they are father and son out for coffee together could be? But one person is dressed up and the other looks very casual what do you think will happen next? I think they will get their coffee and go sit at a table together Good observation! I agree, it appears as though they are together. I too would be glad he was there. haha Look like college kids discussing a recent topic from a class or going over a project I have no idea on the topic"
124,R_2TpgUDbq8UZsaKM,"talking about a business transaction Yes, that is why I am thinking that the man dressed up is asking or providing a service or proposition I think that the man in hooded shirt will order a drink for the man that is dressed up Yes, it appears the man in hood already has a drink and the other does not as it looks like he just arrived I agree they may sit down together after they get the drink I would be glad that the man showed up, since maybe I have been waiting for him unless the man in the hood owes the other one some money :) they are discussing something that was brought up in a class taught by the man standing I do not know what specifically they would be discussing though I agree, this is the most logical conclusion, although what topic is unclear.  He is the teacher of the class It appears they are having a lively interactive discussion, it appears to be an open environment"
125,R_3k89eCesVqMq9fI,HELLO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
126,R_27xoXspshFmLjum,"Maybe they are doing a business deal Or they could just be 2 random people that met at a bar and are talking  That could be Detective would seem to make the most sense I think if it a detective they will get up and leave when they are done asking questions Other person in the sweatshirt will go home or to work I would feel comfortable. Looks like he is enjoying a cupof coffee while talking. No pressure Seems like we are both thinking the same thing Could be a group of coworkers having a small meeting  Maybe discussing a plan or proposal Maybe he was late to the meeting Was also thinking maybe he had been sitting for a while, but nervous would make sense if he needs to move around to calm his herves Overall the mood would seem to be calm. The person sitting with their arm out seems relaxed and so does the person with hands on legs.  Nice working with you"
126,R_22FXdwb8J0GPHCz,"Looks lI think the older man is asking the hooded sweatshirt guy a question. Detective?   Hooded sweatshirt guy is having a coffee, so maybe early morning I think after they get done talking, the sweatshirt guy will go off to work and the other will go to his office.  You? I agree I would feel like this guy is going to get to the bottom of whatever is happening in my life.  I would feel comfortable and relaxed and in good hands. Right! Looks to me like people sitting in an office talking about a business plan or something like that. The guy on the right seems to be the one taking charge.  Almost all the others are looking at him Sounds good to me He looks like one of those guys who can't sit down or has been sitting down for a long time.  Or he is nervous and is standing up. He could also be there boss and is just observing the meeting. I think it is very casual.  They are all sitting down and the one on the couch has his/her hand on the back relaxing.  Seems to be very casual."
127,R_2U3BiswDMQyaoKF,"it seems to be a casual conversation seems we agree  i don't see anything that would give a clue as to what will happen next ready for another beer seems they want us to assume things based on the clothing however with no facial expressions that's just not possible last night's football game he is less interested in the conversation than the others casual, relaxed.  the postures of the people are relaxed"
127,R_27W34wV1mKYlrbU,"Just being friendly. Yes One of them will probably leave, or finish their drink.  No real indication. relaxed yes yes, exactly yes, no idea may be a teacher....or, yes, just not interested in the conversation. seems pretty relaxed can't really tell without facial expressions TRUE"
128,R_1LFIBln7JmBsWBu,"Because they are two lonely saps at a bar together and alcohol brings everyone together. They'll keep talking. That's what you do at bars. Probably a little buzzy, tipsy, maybe feeling underdressed compared to the m'lady wearing fedora man. There was a game of musical chairs, the guy with dark hair thought he won but the two twins with white hair disagree and are arguing it out while the woman in white wishes she didn't go to game night again. He's gettin' ready to pick that chair up and slam it down WWE style if he doesn't win. So tense. They all take gaming very seriously and friendships will forever change because of this moment. Oh yeah, the mood is going dark fast. For sure, that's why he's hiding his hands right now. A green tinge is coming on. Nice talking to you Partner"
128,R_1N4TPkKrLdSbN0p,"that sounds about as reasonable as I can think of.  Either that or they know each other previously and are catching up. They will likely order more drinks and continue chatting. I would think he would feel comfortable It looks like it might be an office meeting, discussing business dealings that is so much better! Pretty sure the man with the dark hair just wants to leave Heated discussion that is about to take a violent turn. Pretty sure the sweater vest of the dark haired man is coming off hulk style Nice talking to you too"
129,R_20SuvZk5cnECvJX,"Probably talking business. Maybe the guy in the sweatshirt is an intern about start at the guys financial corporation Yes, over coffee I think Me too. I don't see a briefcase though.  A condiment dispenser? He looks comfortable sitting there, almost leaning back Perhaps.  He is a little underdressed for the meeting though. He seems confident. It looks like there is rolled up paper on the desk Maybe its plans for a building He looks like he is thinking it over and listening to what the others are saying Maybe he is the silent type ooo that's a good one it would make sense Yes, definitely They do seem intent on what they are talking about. Everyone is focused They seem productive, like they are working to close the deal"
129,R_3080uNKVPD6Fl9M,"I think the man with the pipe is the ma in the sweatshirt's dad and they are discussing business, yes, but what business? Seems they're having lunch or dinner together too I think they might bring out some documents OR shake hands on their business deal. (to sign the documents) what is that contraption in the middle of the table? or a coffee or tea maker but maybe they're discussing a house sale or something he might be a realtor I'd be feeling pretty apprehensive kind of nervous - his poise looks tense. maybe he's going to seal the deal if there is one yeah I agree now that you mention it he does look pretty relaxed Hm, it kind of looks like they might be working on something, like putting something together maybe. or working on that chair right, maybe yeah the woman is standing there kind of expectantly. oh thats a man lol hes waiting on them I think maybe the two men work together and are trying to sell whatever it is that has plans to the man with the black hair It looks pretty relaxed. the guy on the couch seems comfy I would say the mood is pretty energized. they seem excited enough must be a pretty big deal"
130,R_3e8IpF85oWAAnKO,"well we have some people at a bar or diner here perhaps the man with the pipe is some cop and the hoodie is an informant the man with peipe knows what he's drinking lol nice, i agree the man in the hoodie though is a double cross so he might go relay what the cop said crosser* haha he is a snitch, not exactly high standards I would feel like a rat lol he probably doesn't care though he's avoiding jail time he could be thinking about his mother, how sad she'll be if he goes back to prison heartbreaking intervention thats the psychiatrist with the dark hair that empty chair will have their addict sibling in it any moment what do you think? yup nip it in the bud he's leading the dialogue about what the siblings should say, he's from the rehab clinic exactly he's saying like ""good Tim, tell her how it really hurts you"" yup thats her older sister on the couch, whos so tired of her sisters shaninigans its tense for the most part, emotional heartwarming"
130,R_2AZFpcEfPV3vVYk,The man with the pipe is asking the guy in the sweatshirt what he recommends to drink here. The man with the pipe will have his information he needs and leave to go relay that information. ohh I like that idea! I would feel like the normal snitch I am lol no he does not care. It does not bother him in the least bit being a rat. Yes they are impatiently waiting to have an intervention about their sister's drinking habits. He is the psychiatrist and going to be leading the intervention  Tim is the man sitting in front of the chair. And is getting so worked up talking about it his fist is clenched. yes it is very tense. They love their sister and this is very hard for them to confront her. But they want the best for her.
131,R_3M0ruzPO9rM7yVI,"Probably telling him no smoking in the cafe. Or, the guy smoking is shorter, so the hooded guy might be calling him a midget. Talking about women is a high liklihood."
131,R_1BVGOVcpioKo39Y,I agree no smoking in the cafe. Or maybe chit chatting about women. Picking on the mans height could be a possibility but I feel more inclined to say they are chatting about women. My partner has left help!!!!! I would probably be having a quite enjoyable experience. My partner left the chat!!!!! Looks like it might be a business matter by what I can tell about the setting there in. He's possibly leading the discussion. They look like they might be in sort of a serious mood.
132,R_1f7o6mczuTH0lsC,"I think they just met each other at the bar and are getting to know one another. I don't think they are talking about anything that serious. Probably just friendly banter. I think next, they may go somewhere else, or one of them could get up and leave. Mostly because I don't feel like they know each other that well. Possibly so. They could become friends and decide to go to another bar or restaurant. I think I would feel happy to have found a new friend.  I think he's relaxed for sure. Probably happy too. I bet he feels emotional after meeting a new friend. I think they are having a serious family discussion. Yes i think so They look serious and tense They could be arguing about money or something someone did. I think he's fed up and doesn't really want to be there. He feels like he wants the situation over. Yes I agree very serious I think the mood is serious and tense Because they all look serious and on edge Some are probably angry Or annoyed"
132,R_VI6r39gNbh92a6B,"I think so, are they discussing any serious problem? What do you think? May be they can leave together I would feel definitely relax in that situation. Yes of course  Something serious problem? S I mean Yes He is listening carefully  and he is so serious What about that man sitting in the sofa? he is looking relax  I think they are in serious mood and somekind of tense which one?"
133,R_3M5p8vJxsUUA7jg,Looks like they are at a cafe? or a bar? Does not look like the guy in the hoodie is sitting down but the other guy is. Yea doesn't seem like they know each other. The guy will put his pipe away or be kicked out. I don't know if he will leave on his own though. He is probably not thrilled about having to confront the man. Looks like he may have some back up though. There is a person standing behind the guy with the pipe. Looks like they might be watching what is happening. Looks like they are planning something. Maybe plans for the evening. They all seem to be looking at the same person too. He is hesitant to join the convo for sure. Looks like he has his hands in his pockets. He seems worried about their plans. The mood is intense. The other person sitting down looks kind of laid back. Extending his arm out.
133,R_2rUEeXcbHOQB0ux,Seems right.  I imagine the man in the sweatshirt is complaining about the pipe The guy in the sweatshirt could be the bouncer The guy with the pipe will be ejected He probably isn't allowed to smoke indoors doesn't look like he would put the pipe away He seems smaller than the presumed bouncer but maybe he knows martial arts I wouldn't be too worried about this little guy maybe i should be though he seems pretty calm I think he may be another bouncer There is an empty chair.  Maybe for the standing person I think thats the leader.  I think they are planning a crime He is still deciding whether to join them There may be some danger in what they are planning I think he's a little smarter and is doubtful about the plans I think the mood of the seated people is attention to the leader The mood of the stander is hesitance Good point.  Probably not hesitant at all.  Has a lot of trust in the leader
134,R_1Q4IwIQe2Yc0mHI,"I think they planned on meeting there and are having a discussion I think they are having a meeting.  I think he will take off his out and put down his pipe. The other man will ask him to. I think the other man will take a drink of his coffee. Do I have a chat partner? I would feel irritated because of his pipe smoke going into my face. Is anyone there? It appears they are discussing something. Perhaps a map or plan. It looks like something is rolled up on the chair.  This looks like it is in an office or conference room setting.  I think he may be leading a group discussion He also just may need to stand because he was sitting too long.  It looks like a casual, comfortable conversation. Everyone is in relaxed positions.   I hope I am doing this right as I have no partner."
135,R_33lmEOQAZmJ9BlC,"It looks like they're just having a conversation over coffee  I think when the conversation is over, one or both men will finish their coffee and leave  I might feel a bit under-dressed or intimidated"
136,R_ahIvO8g4Iwv3vJD,They look sketchy to me I think they are going to leave seperatly. I think this because they might be doing something illegal I would probably feel paranoid. Looks like they might be having a friendly chat He is probably about to leave It is probably fun and inviting because they all look like friends who are having a good timr
137,R_3hAWTPsgye6RQer,they are old friends from college The man walking in is going to start an altercation with the guys at the bar He heard the guy with the hat slept with his girlfriend What do you think will hapen? I would feel intimidated if I were the man in the sweatshirt How would you feel as the man in the sweatshirt? They are discussing where to go for dinner What do you think they are discussing in this picture? He wants to get going and everyone is just taking their time What do you think? This room must be dull. Some people just want to leave already People want to eat but some are taking too long to decide. There is a bit of hostility in the air.
139,R_vZdoerF0LJ06ZDb,"do you think they could be friends? Or perhaps just sat down next to each other and started a conversation? I think maybe they are acquaintances  maybe they work in the same area and met for coffee I think they'll continue talking, finish their coffees and leave.  Exactly, I agree with you Right, it's just a normal conversation probably I would feel pretty normal. Chatting with a friend and catching up. The pipe inside is funny lol The pipe guy is dressed to the 9's and the hooded sweatshirt guy obviously isn't but that wouldn't bother me Hmm I can't really tell where these people are at Work? They seem to be in business casual attire. Faculty could be right! So maybe they're talking about their students or classes Maybe he just joined the conversation and hasn't say down yet. Or isn't really engaged in the convo? Exactly, he's part of the faculty maybe but isn't involved in the situation they're discussing or something I think it's constructive. They're discussing ideas or issues and coming up with solutions. It's typical as you said I think the mood is like that because they're working together as they have before, it's normal thanks for the chat! "
139,R_1Mk7mIAQJ9DwC0V,"that's what I was trying to figure out. it looks like a coffee shop i think they know each other yea i feel like people don't just strike up conversations with random people in coffee shops most of the time, it seems like people keep to themselves in coffee shops it doesn't really seem like much is going on. they'll probably just keep talking Yeah, it'll be a pretty ordinary and uneventful ending. I can't really see anything particularly interesting happening I'd probably wonder why this guy is smoking a pipe inside, haha. In public. It's hard to say exactly how I'd feel. I guess it depends on how good a friends I am with the other guy. Yeah, I just noticed the difference in their attire in terms of how dressed up one is and how not dressed up the other is. Where do you think they are? Maybe students in a classroom or faculty in an office They look a little old to be students. Yeah Or they're dressed maturely anyways Yeah, they could be talking about the students in their classes or organizing something for their classes. Yeah, that makes sense. He might also be about to leave or just joined and isn't staying long. He seems to belong there. It doesn't seem like the others are excluding him or anything. Like you said, he's probably just a colleague that's on his way out the door or isn't very involved. I feel like the mood is pretty typical for an office/conference room. Everyone seems content, but not overly so Yeah, nothing out of the ordinary. Just seems like a normal office conversation. It seems pretty dull like the kind of thing that happens daily. Everyone seems relaxed. Bingo Oh cool, thanks!"
140,R_ymdJqWwwPl7cqw9,"Maybe the man with the hat is an investigator and the hoodie guy hired him But they seem to be too different to be doing that I think they guy with the hoodie pays the guy with the pipe and they part ways Or they are father and son and he's confronting his son for being a drunk Maybe that is mom behind them, an intevention I would feel like I just want another drink, not the coffee my dad bought me Maybe dad is holding a gun out of sight, lol I thought it was a coffee shop until you said bar which made things much more sinister I see a full blown shootout any second They're talking about why the guy in the hoodie isn't at their AA meeting Hence the empty chair I think this is the first time I've ever believed I'm actually chatting with another MTurker, unless you're a researcher Usually it's obvious it's a bot I figured, the responses were too witty, lol The man in the black hair is leaving because it's a hair club for blond men meeting He's like, what the hell is with all these blond people? I'm outta here! Maybe exorcism practice? lololol Or they're practicing their intervention for when dad brings back hoodie guy ""We care about you hoodie guy, stop drinking so much"" lololol Uh oh, the >> button popped up. It was great chatting with a real Turker! You too!"
140,R_33viArAvpdk8CJx,"I think they are talking about a possible business to start together. Maybe. I just think that a bar is not a common place for a person to be questioned. Or maybe they are planning something illegal. They seemed a little too relax to have that type of conversation. lolol. He probably wants his dad out of there. He is probably asking that man for a lighter. After looking at the picture for a while, I saw that it could be a coffee shop. I guess my mind automatically goes to a dark side lololol It could be!  I am a real Turker  I know  I am real person lolol I think the man is lost. He does not know what to do or where to sit. lolololololol. I am cracking up. The weird thing is that these people look like they are talking to an imaginary person. There is no one sitting there. They are ignoring that man. ""I don't fit in with blonde people...this is not my scene."" That makes sense. The chair must be possessed. Maybe the man that's standing is a ghost. Yeah, that makes the most sense. Stop drinking so much coffee. The continue button just appeared for me. I guess its time to go. Have a good one!"
141,R_2AKaZ7CqodGL5Eo,"Hello The man in the hat reminds me of a movie depiction of a private investigator. I think the guy in the sweatshirt will receive information from the guy in the hat. They will have a drink. If i were having a cheating wife investigated, I would feel a range of emotions. true. lol Probably does. any ideas? Neighborhood watch meeting, lol love it! works for me He is speaking informally. lol The man with the plan OK we can go with that. Like you said, the possibilities are endless. so true. Why would it be intense?"
141,R_2VrM0KnNmpjIpxx,"I have no idea. What is your guess? That is true.  He does look like that.  I wonder how he gets to smoke indoors. I think that they will end up leaving because the guy in the hat can't smoke indoors. Yes, they are in a bar so that is quite possible. I would feel curious as to what the man in the hat had to say. Or a cheating husband, lol... I bet the guy in the hat charges a nice fee for that. It's hard to tell. The possibilities are endless. lol, a meeting of the minds. Maybe going over the chores list for the day? He prefers not to sit. He is the ""overseer."" Big man on campus, lol Yeah It looks a little intense from here. Yep. There's really no way to know unless you're a fly on the wall, literally. They look so serious..."
143,R_3MAlZQT16Ti4I1s,They are probably talking about sports or politics.
144,R_0lBR9R6hF6BLcCB,"theres an investigation with the man in the sweatshirt the man with the pipe is a detective this is the guy who was caught pooping on peoples lawns while he was jogging there was a whole news story about it, it was in california he's getting arrested for pooping on peoples lawns theyre going to light a cigarette and talk in low tones whisper almost I would be nervous too I'd drink my black coffee but not really taste it even though the barista burned it and it was very bitter I'm distracted is your coffee black too? either that or a school could be a class I like that, they are getting their GED's he's teaching the class what is he teaching? I agree, economics I agree, seems very engaging"
144,R_1rjBA36t1j2s4vO,"I think they are grabbing coffee and catching up about work. That makes sense. He has the coat for the part. What is the investigation? Okay that's weird.  What is the detective saying? I'll take your word for it. It doesn't look that tense though. Maybe the detective is just getting more information. What will happen next? They continue their conversation I would be a little on edge. What about you? And I would also want more coffee. Nope with a little milk. The coffee would make me more nervous. They are perhaps in a doctor's office? What do you think? It looks like that too. They are dressed more for school. I think the parents have come in for a chat with the principal. If it's an adult education center That sounds plausible. What do they do during the day? I agree! It looks like he is monitoring a group discussion. And walking around the room to listen to different groups. A business class What do you think? Studious, but also with lively discussion  What do you think? I like that the teacher is letting the students talk among themselves."
145,R_1rdetUWInAASx2x,"They are talking about a crime. Men with pipes do not talk about women. But I agree the conversation could be about anything. Just from my experience from watching crime dramas. The setting is always at a bar or coffee bar. That could be true. The guy with the pipe could be a hit man or something. Or viceversa Agreed. Men with pipes tend to have more money then men with hoodies. I would feel happy that I am getting paid thousands of dollars. Agreed. The man with the hoodie is caught up in a rough situation. They could be talking about having an orgy. Just kidding They could be talking about getting a project done for school. haha That is true Maybe he's been sitting all day and just wants to stand. That is also true I can't think of anything else Beside musical chairs yep The mood in the room seems to be relaxed, I agree. I just realized that the man with black hair could be offering his seat to the other two individuals that seem to be sitting on the floor"
145,R_bPGe86Rtf5Nooxj,They could be talking about anything. Maybe women. Why do you think they are talking about a crime? The hat makes the man look like a mobster so maybe you are right maybe they will exchange money. One will pay the other to do a crime commit a crime The other man is wearing a hoodie so maybe he is a hit man True. Or he could feel like he has to do what the other man wants otherwise the man with the pipe could harm him He might feel like he has no choice i don't know why they are around an empty chair i don't think it's an orgy. they have clothes on. but funny maybe the chair is broken and they are trying to figure out how to fix it the guy on the right seems to be looking at the chair and not the other people but one guy is just lounging on the couch maybe he just walked into the room? could be or maybe he just got up from the chair or maybe he is observing them to see how they interact I think it's a mixed mood the person on the couch seems relaxed the 2 on the floor seem like they are concentrated on the chair and the man standing seems to just be hanging out watching he could be offering his seat
146,R_1MWbTHbcLIP90SV,"maybe they are father and son Could be, random strangers and general converstation at bar. guy in hat looks older, hoodie looks younger since when could you smoke in a bar? Yeah. could be waiting for friends. Guy in hat looks formal to hoodie guys casual. so maybe they are random strangers, or so they think, but after a few drinks they discover they're long lost father and son? maybe hoodie guy is asking hat guy if he'd mind not smoking? Yeah. it does yeah, and they're trying to get the guy standing to come sit in that empty chair. he's a newbie and doesn't fell like opening up yet. yeah, who'd want to sit around talking about their divorce to strangers? especially with the chairs so close together. bar much better. standing guy feels tense"
146,R_2YmNjAwa4y0PZPU,"General conversation (i.e. Where are you from? What do you work? What line of work are you in?) They could be just drinking and random strangers. They are at a bar.  ...but good observation on your part. They will order another drink. Maybe the guy in the hoodie is waiting for friends? Apparently this was pre-2000's? LOL If I was drinking, I wouldn't really care. LOL Depends on what the guy is saying to me really.   That's creative. Or related in some way. It looks like some sort of support group. Maybe is some sad divorce group. LOL He's hesitant to sit with. He probably thinks they are weird.  I wouldn't. That is what the bar is for? LOL It does look a little too intimate. LOL It's called ""personal space"" people! Looks a little intense, I wouldn't want to sit that close to people to have a discussion either. Maybe it's a drug/alcohol treatment center. Are we done?"
147,R_1OTd7yaCVZcwD3X,"The guy with the pipe is a detective interviewins the man in the hoodie who is a suspect in a murder case I think the guy in the hoodie will stand up I would be nervous being a suspect for a crime is quite nerve-wracking after all They are holding an intervention for the black-haired man he has been playing too much World of Warcraft, and his family have gathered to tell him that he needs to step back from gaming a bit because he just walked into the room probably tense and a little somber"
148,R_6ulyJ9g8dX2P4J3,Hello
149,R_10UVH7ndAlsPFvK,They have business to discus I was thinking that guy in the hooded sweatshirt is some young kid guy with pipe is definitely an agent of some kind i'm surprised they are discussing anything at the counter and not at a table a lot less privacy the hooded guy will leave and the pipe smoker will stay for a little longer  that is very possible I think that pipe guy will definitely stay longer so it appears that they were just having a casual conversation or the pipe guy could get him in trouble for something that he's done like being caught with drugs he wants to avoid jail time and a criminal record exactly i would feel uncomfortable especially if i did something wrong and now I'm being blackmailed most definitely afraid wishing I hadn't made a dumb decision that got me involved with this pipe smoker I want to turn back time undo the bad that I did exactly but I'm desperate I have a full ride to Harvard A work problem They are a marketing team They are trying to come up with new advertising They have to advertise for this new boring office chair So they have surrounded themselves around the chair that works too very possible maybe the guy standing in the back is going to go look for steve he believes that something bad happened to steve everyone else thinks that steve is just being an ass about steve he is waiting for the perfect opportunity to go look for steve since he's the only one that thinks something bad happened to steve Everyone else looks more comfortable black haired guy looks tense ready to pounce he is involved in the shady shit yep sounds about right I think it's tense black haired guy is concerned everyone else is just mad that steve is missing everyone else wants to get done to work and not have to worry about steve I was thinking that the person on the couch was a girl they definitely look more ready to work then the girl on the couch shes daydreaming about the marketing project she could care less about steve being missing
149,R_21oX7h5oszAY9b2,"Guy on the hooded sweathshirt is an informant providing information to an enemy agent (guy with pipe) exactly... perfect disguise well, they're definitely speaking in code and inuendo and maybe sweathshirt IS just a kid in desperate situation and agent guy is taking advantage of him so, he's forced to spy to save his sick mother... or something oh yeah... he'll wait till things clear out and he's sure there is nobody scoping him, then leave a tip and saunter out oooo I like it lol poingant question desperate and wanting out of this situation a bit of fear mixed with resentment and disgust and of course, pipe guy just asked me to do something that's WAY more dangerous than previous things yep... working out a new marketing strategy and they just realized that their A player, Steve, is not sitting in his usual spot and now they're sidetracked talking about what an ass Steve is and black hair guy is concerned in fact, he remembers seeing Steve talking to this shady kid in a sweatshirt down in the smoking area earlier that morning Steve is the mole tense and annoyed... and just tense from black hair guy guy sitting on the couch isn't even paying attention other two are ready to work and annoyed though oh yeah... definitely a girl she's had enough of this conversation awwww... "
150,R_33DQz45pbDu78Ax,Hello Do you think theu are at a bar? They are. facing each other I think they are talking because they seem like they are sitting next to each other.
151,R_ZgTqOyzff3cQqgp,"They are just making small talk at breackfast Yes, maybe they are meeting for breakfast before going to the office. .  I don't think gambling They will receive their food Yes, cofee and food.  They look hungary ok I would feel good.   yes, i would feel good and talk bold yes, I agree They are talking about where they should go out THey are wondering if they should go to a movie after dinner He is getting up to go to the restroom yes, he looks comfortable standing i agree the mood is good yes"
151,R_6ulyJ9g8dX2P4J3,Hello! I think they discuss about business deals. But it seems like gambling place. They receive coffee Of course.... It seems like that I will talk bold I feel cool and relaxed They are discussing important topic But they looks serious He feel comfortable by standing Yes I feel I have to make decision This decision is important for me Oh
152,R_urAHqY6qm9zfEM9,The picture is of an L shaped bar.  There are 4 people at the bar.  It looks like they are having coffee
153,R_pB0ITL3mI4ObIL7,I think they are talking about business Isn't that just a part of the bar? I think they will make a business deal based on how they look in the picture I would feel like maybe I'm getting somewhere with the suited man I agree.  Either that or it's a group building meeting He could be standing because he sat too long It think it's a cheerful mood
153,R_8iFvfrTgN61J8Wd,"I'll start.  I think the man in the hoodie is interested in the contraption the man in the hat has. They are clearly at a bar.  You know what, yeah, that might be. It might be a drink dispenser or something like that. Ok, so let's try business.  What business might they have to discuss? That's a tough one.  I think they'll go back to minding their own business.  I don't think they know eahc other. It's fascinating how we interpret things differently.  Probably a reflection of our own personalities. I figured the guy in the hoodie approached the guy with the pipe, but the guy with the pipe wouldn't be interested. I think I'd feel relaxed and at ease, like I didn't have anything to lose.; Interesting.  He kind of reminds me of Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady. He's clearly the best-dressed person in the joint, but I think it's all a put on. Addiction recovery. It has a ""group meeting"" feel to it. The guy to the right is a new member, and they're listening to him. The guy in the background (second from right) is the one in charge. The guy with dark hair (I'll call him ""Stan"") is arriving late. He showed up late and is about to take his seat. He just walked in. That could be, but if that were the case I imagine he'd be closer to the chair and leaning on it. But everybody's different. The guy on the couch isn't sure about being there.  He's bored and considering not coming back. Maybe 6/10 tense. The guy on the couch and the guy standing are disconnected.  The one with his legs crossed is there because he has to be, and the one on the right just needs someone to listen to him. The other three are doing him a disservice. Or yeah, could be cheerful."
154,R_21nZh12Vg7pvQJ3,"Because they are facing one another directly The person coming up from behind will interject in on their conversation. And there will be smiles all around for a short moment until the third continues on and the two go back to their important (possibly nefarious conversation)) ""Just keep chill. I can do this. nothing to be worried about. there is no danger here if I don't act up."" What do do about the rowdy neighbors With a chair as a table. I can see that - an ad hoc meeting But there's a couch too Cause his chair is being used as a table, and the person on the couch has co-opted it for themselves  Maybe not trying to look as pissed about it since he has to be professional  They forced him out, of course he's taking a step back Chill, but for one tryng to become the same The one with the dark hair is not interested in this, perhaps he disagreed from the get go, and the opther two haven't heard of it before"
154,R_1g6MG8oY3LFjLiO,"They are together at a bar or cafe. They could be relaxing and discussing casual topics. Perhaps the guy in the hoodie is asking the man in the hat to stop smoking in a public place. From their clothing, they seem to be different ages. It could be a gay bar, and they leave together for a one-night stand.  A third person shows up to try to deflect the building conflict so that the two don't come to blows. Violence is not expected in a place this nice. I would feel that I was trying to put on a show of being relaxed by putting my arm on the rail. I would want that guy to stop smoking that pipe, unless it has weed in it. I would want him to teach me his wisdom about getting women. This is a casual setting, but they are dressed for work. Something work related? Perhaps they are in a break room? Having an ad hoc meeting? It could be a living room at one of their houses. I was thrown by that chair that doesn't fit with a home. More a school or company. Couch could be for a break room at a company. He is distancing himself from the group. He wants to remain apart from the man on the right, who is leaning forward and talking intensely. The man with black hair has his hands in his pockets. I think he feels defensive. The other two people seem casual, relaxed. The man with black hair might feel that he is under attack. He is protecting himself. His blood could be rising, you're right. That chair also looks uncomfortable. The mood is tense, and has been for a while.  The man with black hair feels under attack. Two people are listening casually. They don't feel culpable. The man on the right is leaning forward, intensely discussing something. He has had this topic on his mind for a while. He wants to resolve the matter, and wants to enlist allies to his point of view."
156,R_1luXvXXqRtSN6HM,"I think they are up to no good... you are optimistic - I think they are plotting something the way the guy in the sweatshirt is leaning back... he doesn't like what they are plotting, but he's still listening. Might be.  But I think he's a mafia boss because he's small, and looks to be controlling the conversation like he's telling is subordinate to go ""off"" someone, or something sinister or maybe I'm just pessimistic! That's a good point but maybe he owns the bar its' all his guys nearby \what happens next. I think they shake hands and agree on something maybe it's a spurned husband asking that smoking guy to help trail is wife. so they agree to a deal...and shake hands. and turn back to the bar and drink their drinks It does look like the one guy is having coffee... that's boring. I'd feel worried about what they are goig to find out about the wife! Oh yeah, I would, too. I'd be talking in code as much as I could But I'd sure be nervous! I think I'd be looking around me to see who's listening. LOL - you are much less sinister Hmmm.... I think these are college buddies planning their weekend. boring. What do you think? It also almost looks like they are making an important decision. They look kind of casual, so it might be a less important decision... not life altering. probably!!  Who has enough cash for the booze! Oh, you said that!   He's probably the money bags and he's just waiting for them to look at him to volunteer to buy. He has his hands in his pockets, like.... ""ok, fine... I'll wait here"". ""You're going to pick me anyhow"" He probably needs a spine to learn how to say no, but it's what gets him invited to parties and such. Yep - I think so! It's probably casual and laughing, talking freely about their plans.  Probably not much tension. Yep - they are excited for their plans I think the guy on the couch(?) is like...""whatever dudes"" I'm just along for the ride.  The two guys seem to be the decision makers and the other two seem fine with it. Yep - laid back Joe. Oh!  We are done!"
156,R_2q3qjrw6ZvggtwL,they could be just making small talk the guy smoking the pipe might be an old man just making small talk why do you think they are plotting something he might be just seems strange to be so out in the open like that i would think they'd at least be in a booth or something thats true maybe he does i'm not sure what do you think will happen next then sweatshirt leaves If I were the guy in the hooded sweatshirt I might be nervous that the other people can hear what we're talkinga bout about IF they are even talking about anything bad. They could just be making small talk might not even know each other before today lol something heated maybe excited or upset well since the other two people are standing I doubt they're upset though lol they might be who's gonna get the liquor for their outing lol exactly! lol right ! lol right he's the gopher to be used  i think they're getting hyped up about whatever they are talkinga bout about atleast the 2 on the right are yup looks like it he'll go along with whatever they are planning exactly
157,R_33DQz45pbDu78Ax,"Hello, I think they are talking because they are facing each other. They seem to be sitting next to one another as well. the man in the sweatshirt has a relaxed posture with his arm rested on the counter it seems like a pretty common senaro, to be chatting with a stranger at a bar. I think the guy with the pipe will remove it from his mouth so he can add to the conversation. The person behind the man with the pipe looks like he may want to join the conversation as well. I think I'd be in a fairly good mood, being out at a bar, probably on a Friday night. Enjoying a chat with a rondom stranger. Right, someone who can give you some non bias advice and who doesnt like making new friends... yes, maybe they are making small chat while they wait for another co worker to arrive there is an empty seat in front of the one person and it looks like whoever is sitting there is the center of the conversation. He seems like hes more likely to observe the conversation than to take part in it. Maybe he sits all day at work and needs to stretch his legs. or he has social anxiety I think the mood is very professional. It looks like a business meeting."
157,R_1rNbsSR91YebxR8,maybe theyre just chatting but theyre strangers in a bar Yes thats right i think theyre both relaxed good one! i dont think so. i think he's just looking somewhere else. I think id feel nice to talk about my issues with someone who doesnt know anything about me and wont judge me. exactly They seem like coworkers.  maybe theyre talking about some work related topic. they seem very serious. maybe maybe is some kind of simulation that can be a reason too.
158,R_2CV9oaYMKbSofkR,"It seems to me that they are talking about sports. Why do you leave me friend I think that the sweatshirted man will say goodbye and leave since it appears that he is already on his way out and just stopped to say a word. Notice that he is not sitting. I would be amazed because the man I'm talking to must be from the past. He is wearing a hat which went out of vouge fifty years ago while the hooded sweatshirt didn't become popular until the late 60s. They are discussing the chair and how best to repair it. There are no more seats available. The person on the couch is man spreading and left no room for anyone else. I think that they are in a friendly mood, though the man who's standing is outside the conversation and is just hoping to be included."
160,R_2aOXz7Gz0UyjH8Y,They are neighbors
160,R_240KuMdiFUzhUan,"They are father and son They will have a drink Because they're waiting for a table for dinner Happy to be having dinner and spending time with my father. They are having a business discussion. He is just arriving to the discussion. He was busy on an international call so he's a little late. The room is full of nervous energy but they are optimistic. They have just gotten a new, important client."
161,R_3k4ZJl13wW2Ha82,"they are friends they meet here often to discuss their life events  they are trying to solve a case and are taking a break  they are going to each go their separate way and continue their day  one will go to work and the other person to their detective office I would feel worried that the caffeine migh start kicking in and he move They are talking about jesus in a bibile study class they are discussing a passage in the bible which meant something to them today they do indeed  he is probably tired from having sat for a long time he does his own thing he needs to go soon and that is indicating that he is leaving the intense part might be over, it feels like their lingering on something instead of keep going finish the agenda"
161,R_3C1GYR4J99Di67n,they are at breakfast chatting the man with the pipe might be his dad maybe they are at odds about something they will get up and shake hands and leave i think the guy in the hoody may go jogging i would feel relaxed and happy. I would feel refreshed looks like they are talking about something they did in the past together thats a good observation. dont they usually have a bible though? he is just a person who prefers standing to sitting he may have some anxiety too or he is about to leave seems fairly serious. Like they are discussing something deep
162,R_1gABhieHHkZDpK8,"Maybe the man with the pipe is hiring the man in the sweatshirt to do something Yes, it seems weird for them to be dressed so differently I agree And the fact that the man with the pipe is sitting down and the man in the sweatshirt is standing up Maybe a business acquaintance I think they might exchange moeny *money The man in the sweatshirt will probably go outside and head off to get ready to do the job The man with the pipe might hand him a photo or something to help with the hit The man with the pipe will probably finish his drink I would probably feel nervous but he is probably used to the job He might just be happy to get the money and get going He might feel bad about killing a woman this time Probably strangling It looks like they're having some kind of discussion. Maybe they're coworkers Yes, it does look like a teacher's lounge Yes, it doesn't look like a formal meeting It looks like they are sitting around on break talking about the students  He's probably standing because he doesn't have much time and is just popping in That too It looks like the man on the far right is the one everyone is paying attention to Maybe the man on the right is going too far with what he's saying and the man standing up doesn't agree with him Having his hands in his pockets could either be closed off or relaxed I think the mood is probably fairly relaxed but intense discussion The person closest to the foreground looks relaxed in how they're seated but the man with his hand on his knee looks very invested in the conversation"
162,R_xGyqb5iFW4e5W13,"I agree. I think he is hiring a hitman. Also, a pipe reminds me of something sketchy happening. Who do you think he wants to kill? I bet he wants his wife dead. Yes, and then they will stand up and go separate ways The man with the pipe will get on the phone and say everything is ready to go Yes, definitely He will go get in his car. It's probably raining outside. If I were the man in the hooded sweatshirt, I would feel nervous. Yeah, that's true. He's used to killing people. I wonder how he will kill her. I wonder how much money he'll get. They look like they are in a teacher's lounge Yes, definitely! Maybe they are talking about students behaving poorly I bet they are high school teachers I think he's standing because he's just listening to the conversation, not participating Yes, agreed. Nobody values his opinion. Yeah, he's probably really frustrated with a group of kids that have been skipping his class. Yeah, it looks like they are going back and forth having a debate about something I agree it's relaxed because they are seated. But their hands do show intensity Yes, I think it's tense and everyone is a bit on the edge of their seat"
163,R_3g1PHrKnKYjnh7Y,Hello?
164,R_1hM6e0EOSP648Cs,give me drink yes they are looking like a friends i think one of them go out the place. yes yes nothing They are talking about his family situation This place is looking hospital Waiting for his turn to checkup maybe the black hair man is a middle stage person. so he standing for the responsible. The mood in the room is serious I think they are discussing for the critical operation.
164,R_2XoDIzTn4xpX7em,"I think they're talking because they don't look like they came with anyone else.  But it's also possible that the two are friends and just dress differently.  I think one of them will probably order a drink It looks like they're in a cafe, so probably a coffee That makes sense too, one of them very well likely may leave If I were the man in sweatshirt I would feel comfortable. Based off his body language in the picture he looks comfortable in the situation.  However, I would not want the other person to keep smoking. I'd prefer if they did that away from me.  What do you mean by ""nothing""? They could be talking about memories with each other  The man on the far right looks pretty serious  You're right, it does! It's possible they're discussing a patient.  He may be the one in charge  I see that. His hands in his pockets does make him look like he's waiting on something. That could be possible. He seems important.  I think the mood in the room is very serious and heavy. They probably aren't joking around or laughing. I agree. I don't think the four of them are having a fun time. Whatever they're discussing is a serious matter."
166,R_1ISFoyhz9bcYwan,"Maybe the weather? Do you think that they know each other or are they strangers? I think that the guy in the sweatshirt will get up to leave. I wouldn't want that pipe smoke in my face if i was him, LOL yeah, i don't think they'll continue chatting that's a good possibility seeing as though i don't particularly like smoke or strangers, I would feel like getting up and either leaving or moving to a different spot in the bar/restaurant maybe it's an AA meeting or an intervention, don't know why that's my initial thought though (haha) or maybe it's a work meeting sports is a good guess, always a safe topic! a meeting of the minds i think that he is a late arrival yeah, that chair doesn't look very comfortable and the other person is taking up the whole couch/sofa i think the mood is light. everyone looks pretty casual you might be right hard to tell since there aren't any facial expressions kind of have to read the body language"
166,R_Ofp5yNRYiguwjYJ,Or something they saw on the news? Could be the weather though Based on how they are dressed I initially thought strangers. But maybe they know each other and the meeting just wasn’t planned? I think they conversation will end shortly because the meeting wasn’t planned.  That’s true. The smoke is right in his face. They might turn straight and order food or something  I think I would feel fine minus the smoke that you mentioned Yeah you’re right he might be pretty annoyed actually He could be asking the guy to stop smoking My guess is politics or sports.  It also kind of looks like they are planning something  Yeah I think it’s a work meeting now. He could be tired of sitting Maybe the other guy is a real talker it looks pretty serious to me. You? Hard to tell. The person on the couch is very laid back  The 2 to the right look serious though 
167,R_3MSUWgvuyO7p0kw,"Well, it looks like they are in a coffee bar. Maybe they are discussing the options for coffee? Pobbible. Also, the guy in the hat is smoking a pipe. Maybe the guy in the hoodie is chastising him for smoking indoors.  If they are arguing about the pipe, the argument could continue outside the coffee bar. Does it become physical?  Ticked off that the man is smoking inside.  Would you continue the discussion/argument outside? I think they are staging some form of intervention about the guy on the right. Drinking? Drugs?  Could be, but what? Feels it gives him more power in the discussion? Or it could be painful for him to sit.  Tense, possibly compassionate. If an intervention do you think he'll go into rehab?"
167,R_1Xm6dvUGUhFPWaR,"They might be talking about a recent crime and where was he during the time of the crime.? Maybe a little frustrated if he isn't leaving, I wouldn't continue it. I don't want the problem to get worse. They might discussing plans for something? It looks like he just arrived. Yeah, possibly Yeah, I think it might be kind of tense there."
168,R_1Cdy30Xx39Aygf9,I think they are friend who met for coffee and are having a friendly conversation I think they finished up their coffee and went their separate ways I would feel good and energized after meeting with my friend to catch up Seems like they are meeting to discuss plans for something He's seems to nervous to sit down It seems a little tense but looks like it's an informative meeting
169,R_2B4nCkxq4FGw8nW,"Hello nono is more like two people talking in a cafe look serion but private investigator can be a good theory Well, it seems like a family discussion I think it must be reaching the group"
169,R_1hYyC0vScou4NBI,Hi  that is man of the hood contract the man of the girl who looks like a private investigator I would be relaxed since I am having a conversation with someone I like about a certain topic  I think they are talking about politics  I think that the state of mind is something I have in the room because the subject in which it is spoken
171,R_3fPOAGvtecJvUqP,"I think the man with the pipe is a detective.. He looks very Sherlock Holmes-y What do you think? Maybe the man with the pipe will offer to pay for the man's coffee and then write something in his little detective notebook and walk out Yeah, I think they are in a movie too That sounds good, i agree I'd feel slightly intimidated and suspicious Looks like a group therapy session to me maybe like an addicts support group sounds good, we'll go with that my idea is depressing lol Maybe because he's about to leave the room, but got sucked back into the conversation for a moment Ha! They are sitting pretty close If it's a sports discussion it's probably loud, lively and a little intense yeah they definitely look defeated"
171,R_1BVmpI3orn7ju8Q,"Yes, it looks like an old time coffee shop Maybe they are in a movie and they are discussing what comes next I think they will shake hands and the man with the hat will leave I would feel like I was under investigation yes exactly Could be a bunch of guys talking about a sports game He must be the leader  or he just doesn't like sitting that close to a bunch of guys I think their team lost.  They look very ticked off"
172,R_1f2UHDUECO2Vt3y, hanging out at a bar with friends                                      YES YOU SATISFIED HOSPITAL YES Your partner has arrived! Chat will begin in 5 seconds... GO FOR NEXT STEP QUICKLY
172,R_3imrWRzhq8xKWf0,hanging out at a bar with friends The man will get another drink because his is empty i would feel like i was in a good mood hanging with friends its a group project and they are talking about how useless the one partner is because he is angry at his useless partner who is not being helpful at all very bad because everyone hates the useless partner
174,R_23V9LMlbaUQi4ty,Still waiting...
175,R_1mVk974RnlveFOx,"is he a private investigator? or maybe a mobster thst is my guess, what do you think they are discussing? the man will leave the store, not the mobster i would be scared I think I agree, or playing a game together, like charades he may be the leader or showing an example of something yeah, there seems to be a seat open there, maybe he just arrived"
175,R_21uib8FE0GQeGlD,"A mobster They are discussing about business No I would be very nervous very nervous about business, I think he must be explaining something"
176,R_2cBlL3xLI61cPrq,Hi! I think they are maybe just at a coffee shop or bar and just happen to be sitting by one another.
177,R_28P4pI94SCnZZZV,"Hello. It looks like a detective at a bar or dinner I think an investigation I think the pipe and hat are a little elaborate as FBI tends to try and look inconspicious. I think more of a private detective in love with Sherlock Holmes I think the guy in the sweatshirt will get hostile or defensive and try to leave because he doesn't like where the questioning is going, he probably looks guilty laughs, I was thinking the pipe guy would use the cup to smash his face I would probably feel like I'm in trouble and figure out how to run and get out of it If I was more aggressive, I would grab the gumshoe's tie and tell him to back off looks like an intervention about to start, someone is missing i thought funeral looked possible too the empty chair in the center is odd I guess he should be in the chair, but he's defensive and wants away from them the other guy is right at the chair, so it looks like some heart to heart maybe blond guy came out and black hair is unsupportive tense from black hair, but sympathetic from woman. Must be like after funeral atmosphere couch potato is relaxed, look at them taking up the entire couch"
177,R_1Gv71a1Twnmrk6l,"was going to say the same, but an FBI agent of some sort well that pretty much sums it up i was hoping he would use the coffee cup and smash the guy with the pipe in the face. he does look like he's leaning back a bit being a bit defensive i'd be like who the hell are you and leave me alone gumshoe...wow haven't heard that word in a while how to divy up dad's asset's after he passed away in this case anything could be possible or the guy with black hair yea, probably shocked or surprised to see what's about to happen the mood is definitely quite serious."
178,R_3fCqJ5wl9igcDEx,I think the two men are talking about why the man with the pip is smoking inside a bar.
179,R_2qf3v5NvSFzMUZu, I think they met each other at a bar to discuss a business deal.   It looks like a bar to me   Maybe they met each other on a dating website   Maybe they will go to another location to discuss whatever they are discussing further    The man who is smoking will invite the other man over to his apartment   Send me the man in the background doesn’t seem involve   Like you said they do look like opposites. However the man who smoking might have something interesting to tell him   The man with the sweatshirt looks kind of young and naïve to me   If they were related and living in the same home you would think they would be talking at their house   Maybe it’s a parent teacher conference?   I would think they would have a paper and a pen if they were discussing strategy   Two people look like they’re talking and th other people look like they’re just listening   He’s just listening to the other two talk   That’s possible   I agree.   It seems like the two that are talking are very concerned about something   It’s either about something sad or just something serious 
179,R_5yWx895SPgEdzcl,"I think they're talking about their different lifestyles They could have just met. lol - They're kind of opposites to me I think they'll possibly buy another coffee and talk some more They could be talking about the man in the backround The man in the backround could be listening  he looks strong and young.  He'll be able to handle himself in any situation Maybe he's the father of the man in the sweatshirt He could be The man with the pipe looks very intense It looks like a work breakroom and their having an important conversation I think they're working on a strategy of some sort I agree.  The man standing could be the center of the conversation Yes, but the conversation is possibly about him The person in front isn't as interested as the two guys in the back Or the man in the black hair is the leader of the group It looks like they're not having a happy converssation Maybe their boss is horrible and they want to report him The only one looking not interested is the one in front"
180,R_1dicSAs7it06pS6,hello my name is sara they are friends I do not think that's why I think it's because they're friends because they're talking they will continue talking as friends I insist with that they are friends according to my chat partner he will be disgusted by the smoke of his pipe 4 men talking about women of women is asking something or discussing some topic can be reunited with a strategy jajaja he looks calm if they were altered several estubiesen of feet jajaja you crazy
180,R_3fCqJ5wl9igcDEx,"hi I think the 2 men are arguing about why the one with the pipe is smoking in a bar. I don't think they're friends at all.  I think they just met. I think the man in the hoodie will leave because he can't stand the man in the suit's smoke. ok. I don't think they are, but I'm willing to keep an open mind. I think I would feel upset that the man in the suit, who may or may not be hid friend, insists on smoking indoors at a bar. I'm guessing sports. Just one woman or women in general? Because he's the alpha-male of the group and standing puts him in the position of power. I bet he really wants to stand on the chair. It's probably very stressful and hostile. I think the other three know they can take down the one with black hair and that they could use that chair as a weapon. I don't know what jajaja means."
181,R_1nZ6thhHUhbZ6A9,"They are both interested in smoking a pipe, and are making small talk about it What do you think? I think the two men will find a nice place to go smoke together. They are both interested in smoking, so after discussing it, they will want to do it. I might feel like I made a new friend, and would be happy. I agree, I think they are reminiscing about old good times they've had together. He may have been sitting all day, and doesn't wish to sit at this time. What do you think, nice SERVER. Yes, I agree. I think they are very laid back. Just chilling. Thanks!"
181,R_2XoogJSTgn91jHY,"If they both interested in smoking pipe it may be a nice conversation. They also share their smoking experience. They are also share the various type pipes and smoking instruments.  I'm also having the same feeling. It will going to be awesome. I think they are close friends. They are discuss about their memories. I agree with you.  As per their body language, It may be a very casual talk."
182,R_3qpXw3UV6S3zWu1,"I think its something about business But do people really wear hats in the diner? Maybe its his son or something and theyre talking about something business related or setting up a crime  yea i think so too I think the guy in the hood ie si going to sip his coffee his hand is really close to it yea or maybe the guy in the hoodie is going to get up, he looks like hes leaning yes I would feel angry that the guy is puffing smoke in my face and thats why hes leaning lol and in general that pipe is big coming at his face. I would just be aggravated with this hat guy altogether maybe playing a game like charrades but the one guy is standing instead of sitting like some type of controversy yes, but he choose not to sit on that chair in front of him maybe hes shy and does not like them an theyre talking business i didnt even notice that hes standing because maybe hes younger i agree like he does not know them or connect with them to well i think the mood is probbaly fine but awkard to the one guy like if someone walked in it would be fine until they looked at him because he is obviously some kind ofoutsider"
182,R_31peLcUTAd5xfag,"It looks like a diner, probably just chatting the type that walks around with a pipe in their mouth, yep. look at his partner, the other guy's very casually dressed, in a hoody if it's business, it's going to be some sort of local, small business. More likely than not it's more casual than that, could be a son or someone they know well, too like you mentioned I figure maybe a waiter will bring another drink over, too. since between the two of them, there's only one cup visible nearby yeah you're right, the way he's depicted he might not be sitting unnatural position for someone on a bar stool there's distance between the two of them, if they're close one of them should be leaning in closer he's leaning back like he's on guard or trying to keep distance haha that too maybe he's just trying to stay away from the smoke one man's in a hoody, the other's in a suit.  Like they're from very different backgrounds yeah I guess the hoody guy's generally uncomfortable from the way he's leaning back and kind of scrunched up hard to tell, but the guy on the right most side of the picture is doing the telling like he's an outsider or black sheep of the group there's distance between him and everyone else he's got black hair while everyone else seem to have white or very light colored hair some kind of emotional distance from the rest, maybe he's younger or a different race yeah, like you said, there's a chair for him but he's not sitting in it I think the three people talking are relaxed and at ease, while the mood is awkward for the black haired man alone yep yeah, just standing there with his hands in his pocket"
184,R_10CacK37RvzjnkQ,...
185,R_2dgzM9dAU9JaIxZ,"They are father and son I also think that it could possibly be a business deal, it appears they arranged to meet ahead of time They are also probably talking to each other because they are next to eachother That would make sense, perhaps their talking about his future Good insight, I agree with you Yeah although it appears he is drinking coffee I think in the next picture they might have some food because they could be hungry Also possible Or maybe this is toward the end of the conversation and they will leave TRUE Yeah I agree Right and the older man seems distinctive as he smokes his pipe Perhaps he's fearful of the future and what might come It appears to be a work meeting since they have collared shirts Yeah I can't tell if their outside or not Perhaps he's just arriving Or he's in charge asking them to come back to work Or maybe he was sitting down and felt uncomfortable so he stood up Yeah I would agree that seems more accurate I would say it's a casual coversation I agree with you, it seems like they are listening well to each other Agreed They seem to be pretty relaxed"
185,R_O3YsUxpZy9lC5KF,"I think they are grandfather and grandson speaking about what the grandson should do for his future since he is above highschool because it's a bar I would assume it's after college or approaching graduation You may be right I agree or another drink Perhaps, they may have already eaten I think it would have been intense because it's clearly an older man behaving seriously and speaking to a younger man so there must be a level of respect towards the older man I agree The level of respect I infer because the older man feels he can smoke It looks like a work meeting casual meeting in a break room yes in a break room or lobby maybe after finishing the day any other insight? You may be right The guy with black hair seems to be the one in charge because he is standing it seems like he just walked up and wasn't part of the initial meeting It seems casual because the person on the couch seems relaxed with their arm extended certainly not an intend conversation I agree"
186,R_OO6PrhDWfg6zKM1,"I suppose they are discussing business. Hello They are discussing a transaction. They will smile at each other. Ok. I suppose I would feel quizical. Ok. hello I would expect an answer. I think they are talking about a class. A university class. hello? . He came to the meeting late. He feels more comfortable standing up? Why hasn't the picture changed yet? I think it is happy, with comradeship and relaxed. ok."
187,R_25gFFbDI9PCLyBr,"Hmmmmm...it looks like something shady, but that's because of the pipe and hat Wht do you think? Okay, sure! It's a man who thinks he's being cheated on and a private eye I think the private eye will leave and go do his investigating Anxious, apprehensive possibly Theyre in a hospital lobby waiting with the man on the right Ooooo yeah. Because they're all looking at that guy on the right He's uncomfortable ......or because that chair is way too close to the other guy! I was thinking that exact word worried if they're in a hospital"
187,R_1KwLSZdPXewf1Gb,"something about women maybe or probably a secret job like in the movie lol yeah and the other guy will buy him a drink  neutral until he threatened me, thats different then an intervention. trying to help a friend because he felt threatened  or he might felt anxious about the topic maybe tense because he doesnt want to be there  its possible"
190,R_23V9LMlbaUQi4ty,"Just general conversation with at a bar...companionship  With a another person* Actually, it looks more like a coffee shop.  Awesome...  =/ Maybe, they will shake hands.  Because that is polite and normal in this type of situation.  Fine, although, I think he might be a little uncomfortable that the other gentleman is smoking inside an establishment.  This looks like a meeting place  - either work or a stereotypical AA meeting setting.  There is a gentleman standing away looking uncomfortable.   They might be discussing a new project at work, an he is either new or uncomfortable with this group. He is probably uncomfortable for some reason.  Mostly relaxed, except for the man with the black hair, who seems to be feeling out the situation. "
191,R_1laDlKJrSONikQI,hi
193,R_3KqNzPwhCxHoSHN,Hello?
194,R_1Kd2dW9SQ0pq9Ei,"I think they're probably talking about sports I feel hoodies usually have sports logos on them, so the guy in the hoodie is probably a sports fan. They're also at a bar, so its probable that its a sports bar and they're watcing a game"
195,R_26hI7Vr5chDL2XS,"They want to pass the time while waiting for their food  They will probably be served food and begin eating Relaxed, enjoying the conversation an atmosphere Seem to be sharing recent stories at a friendly get together He seems somewhat excluded from the group Casual mood, however because of the outsider there could be some awkwardness "
198,R_1Kd2dW9SQ0pq9Ei,"I think they're talking about sports The guy in the hooded sweatshirt probably likes sports and it might have a sports logo on it I also feel a majority of bars have TVs that play sports games so it is possible they're watching that Hmm. Well it looks like maybe theres another person coming up behind the guy with the hat I think that person might also be a sports fan and might try to join the conversation. I think I would be a little intimidated. Encountering a person wearing a hat indoors and smoking a pipe just seems kind of taboo for this to be taking place today in 2018 But I believe the conversation wouldnt get too heated or out of hand.  I just would probably be looking for an out This picture looks interesting because the chair the guy is facing looks kind of funky It almost looks like he wants to arm wrestle with someone And is waiting for someone to get in front of him to wrestle I think they look like a group of college boys having a good time I think the man with the black hair is approaching to sit in the seat, or they're trying to convince him to sit in the seat The one guy is kneeling because he is the judge to see who wins and gets the best view from the side The man with the black hair is probably either saying its a stupid game and he doesnt want to play or he is confidently walking up and accepting the challenge"
199,R_1GB4YYcyJw9jv9D,ok
200,R_1f2UHDUECO2Vt3y,HI PARTNER
203,R_3FVyrPvLszTJz9n,"Probably because they are sitting near each other and both are alone He might be asking the one with the pipe to stop smoking It almost looks like a conflict might occur, their body language is kind of stiff. I'm not sure what that means, leave the counter? He seems a little uncomfortable I know I wouldn't like someone smoking a pipe near me in a restaurant I think I would as well I might be hesitant to return as well Perhaps another member of the group, there appears to be an empty chair. They seem to be listening intently, so it must have been importatn Maybe he is uncomfortable with the conversation His hands are in his pockets and he is a good distance away from the other people Just doesn't look comfortable Tense Because of their body language and space between them Oh I got a totally different feeling from the picture At least from the standing guy"
203,R_1laDlKJrSONikQI,"They are solving a problem there is complete attention between both Each one will go by his side Yes, it is observed that the discussion is interesting for them I would feel threatened Eager to leave the place From an event that occurred on your work day The events that occurred are of interest to all He is carefully observing the expression on the face of the storyteller Stressed by sitting because of that he is standing The discussion is relaxed and interesting they all look very closely at the narrator's expression"
204,R_1Kd2dW9SQ0pq9Ei,is there anyone actually there
205,R_3fjjm4xt6D5uxNM,"They could be talking about business. That seems more likely.  Maybe. Older people would be more likely to have a pipe  or drinking their coffee they could just be there for coffee and not food. I would feel relaxed, especially if the other person is a grandparent like we suggested Maybe I would feel more alert after having some coffee That could be or some kind of work meeting. informal meeting It definitely seems like they are collaborating on something. He could be the leader of the group or the boss. Maybe they had been sitting for some time so he needed to stretch his legs The mood seems low key because everyone is mostly in comfortable positions"
205,R_2wERGvRwYQzuYnX,"They are probably friends just having coffee chatting. It might be his grandpa what do you think They will probably start eating food. Drinks typically come first then food. You may be right I would feel comfortable. I would also feel more alert after coffee. Probably a school project. That makes sense as well. He probably does not want to sit.. or the leader/boss but also probably does not want to sit. I feel like the mood would be relaxed because the person on the couch has their arm out  on the back of it and the guy sitting across from the black hair man, he has his leg propped up it appears."
206,R_1ms0M8WUnODhMZQ,They are talkin about something going on in the news
208,R_3KqNzPwhCxHoSHN,"Hello! I wonder if the survey wants us to make up a story here. Perhaps the man in the sweatshirt is telling the man with the pipe that he should not be smoking in a cafe. Current events also is plausible. I think one of them will leave. It looks like the guy with the sweatshirt has his coffee, but the pipe-smoker has nothing. Gee, I don't know. Relaxed? He doesn't seem tense or anxious. The body language is relaxed, non-defensive. This looks like a college study group. Except there are no books. Yes, perhaps during a break from work. It looks they all are male. Exactly. Or maybe he just arrived and is listening to what they guy on the left is saying. Thoughtful, I'd say. Or maybe creative. Neither of those are ""moods,"" but they get at what I see. That's it? Gee."
208,R_1ms0M8WUnODhMZQ,hello sounds like it  I think they are talking about some sort of current event that is plausible Yeah I think one of them will get what they came for and leave. Yeah he is probably waiting on his order and they are just chatting Yeah I would probably be relaxed it seems like a normal situation he probably finds himself in all the time This could be some sort of work project But like the study group they should have laptops or something Yeah a break at work or something sounds better If it is a break from work he might be tired of sitting at his desk for a long time Yeah that would be a good reason too  Or he is about to walk away Yeah if it is at work they are probably still talking about work stuff so creative would work
209,R_2CTWETNIEUQJ3DT,"I think they're just hanging out at the bar and making conversation hbu? I think they will shake hands and leave the bar going to their own homes. I would think the man in the hooded sweater was going to rob the other guy or fight him! Work stuff, maybe a promotion He is getting his performance review, and no other chairs. sounds good too what's next? I think the mood is kind of awkward Maybe the guy standing especially is an outsider, feels like one yeah lol"
209,R_vrHOjRwH01rskIV,Maybe they are father and son and went out for a drink do they know each other or just met one is drinking coffee so is this in the morning and afterwards they go to work he seems attentive and on guard  about their feelings towards that one man yea I go with work stuff maybe he just walked in on the conversation he seems younger than the others i agree that it is akward almost seems like an intervention test
210,R_2EfRQXvW2bA0xk3,"I think they are just having a casual conversation. hello! yes, perhaps the world cup yes, the guy in the hat is not happy the US didn't make it. I think they go back home yes, agreed. It is tough just standing at a bar they need to sit down yeah, he is smoking.  Where is this at? It must be vapor of some kind I would feel distracted by the smoke now that I think of it, but interested I don't talk to guys in suits often, so I am curious. huh maybe it is a trench coat It looks like the dark haired one just gave them some news now they are discussing it yes they are looking at him he is in thought oh no, I  hope this works well at least for the sake of the guy on the right why is that chair right in front of him? oh thats funny I don't think the black haired guy wants to sit down Yeah, it looks like a bed chair It's too close. He likes his personal space The person on the left is pretty comfortable though I think the mood is low All their heads are down just a bit yes, he is tense. I agree Maybe the black hair guy is a doctor of some kind in a waiting room? bye you too!"
210,R_1Kd2dW9SQ0pq9Ei,"omg you're a person hello I think they're talking about sports Ohhh thats a good idea I just feel bars usually have TVs with games on So those are a topic of discussion Plus sweatshirts are popular for having sports logos on it Oh you know Theres no chairs They're all standing I imagine next they will part ways Yes I agree It looks like maybe the guy in the hat hasn't gotten his drink yet so hes just waiting I think smoking in bars has been illegal for like 10 years in the US lol Maybe, if they made vapes in the shape of pipes lol. I wouldn't doubt it, I've just never seen it Yeah I'd probably feel a little weird talking to him Just in case management approached him about it It would make me feel awkward to be associated with it especially if he is difficult he honestly looks more like its probably a trenchcoat Oh news involving the guy on the right maybe It looks like everyone is looking at him The first time i did this (my chat partner d/c and it made me restart lol) I said they were arm wrestling and theyre trying to pressure the guy with black hair to sit on the chair to arm wrestle and the other guy is the referee Well the chair looks really weird too cause theres that thing in the middle Yeah his hands in his pockets kind of say he doesnt really want to engage too much Yeah he looks really comfy and stretched out Like tense ? I think the guy on the right can be seen as clenching his fist maybe They definitely are not happy I don't think hes a doctor, but they could be in the waiting room Just because his outfit is wrong byeee! have a good day!"
211,R_8vPlDk8f9d0VOKt,good good yes good
211,R_31m7XXP9rv0GbbI,"Hey. Hmm, I think the guy in the hat cut off the man in the hoodie with his car and the hoodie guy followed him to confront him. What about you? Is that all you can say? I think the hoodie guy will throw hot coffee on pipe guy. What about you? LOL saw that answer coming... So helpful."
212,R_31m7XXP9rv0GbbI,"Hi! I think the man with the pipe cut off the man with the hoodie in his car and hoodie guy followed him into the diner to confront him. You? Weird, you don't see a picture from the Server? Do you see the next pic? Sweet. I think the hoodie guy will throw hot coffee on pipe guy. His body language looks heated. If I were hoodie guy I would be ticked off that pipe guy is smoking indoors like it's 1957! Although now that I look closer, the diner appears to have ashtrays on the counter so maybe this is an olllllld drawing And haha yes hoodie guy can't believe what he's seeing.  Hmm looks like group therapy to me I thought coworkers too at first but not many offices have nice big couches to hang out on, sadly. And yes, especially the standing guy with dark hair! He's about to drop dead from boredom. I think he just got up out of that chair because he didn't want to listen to what far end guy is saying He put his hands in his pockets before he punches the guy Orrrrr he's just REALLY bored and playing with the change in his pocket. This may be another old picture, from the time before you could just whip out your phone when someone is boring... Hard to tell, the one guy on the end looks interested and engaged. I think you're right, it's a work scene. And they don't particularly like each other Totally, the lady (?) stretched out on the couch is like ""ugh there goes Bob again..."""
212,R_1FrXp1gllBBFtky,"I don't see a picture here. No, I do not. Very strange. All I see is this chat box. Yes. I think the man with the pipe will leave the diner. Maybe, but he doesn't look that angry, Tense, yeah. I would be attempting to remain patient. True!! I would also think the pipe guy was pompous. The hoodie guy might be amused by this eccentric fellow. Very old. I didnt think you could smoke anywhere indoors anymore. I think these folks are coworkers planning an evening out later. Could be their coffee break room or something. They look like they're bored and need some fun. That guy is bored. Or uninterested. Or he doesn't want to be there. That sounds about right. Or he's trying to look nonchalant. To hide the fact that he's bored. Not a cohesive group going on there. The mood is the opposite of exciting. The guy on the right loves hearing himself talk. I agree. The guy in the middle is trying to be polite. Could be the guy on the right is the supervisor."
213,R_wRBPzJAFwoDlS9j,the two person sitting on the chair now smoking and then they will start the conversation with drinks they are all friends and partners. i think they talk about business dealing three persons are partner and standing man is the employee i think this is meeting room because three business man and one employee in the room
214,R_3KqNzPwhCxHoSHN,"Greetings! Did you already see this picture? OK, so I'll let you go first. I already saw this in a previous round. Yes. I agree. Here I previously said that what might happen next is that one of them will leave. The guy with the sweatshirt has a coffee, but the pipe-smoker does not seem to have anything. But the pipe smoker has his hat on, so either he's leaving or just arrived. My reaction to this prompt was that I would feel relaxed. The sweatshirt guy's body language suggests he is relaxed. This looks like a study group in college, except there are no books. I agree. It could be a group of co-workers. Could be. Or maybe he's tired of sitting. True. I think the mood is ""thoughtful,"" like they are debating some idea."
214,R_eEUCP2hab5DGnEl,"Hey. :) This is my first picture. I just imagined them being strangers sitting next to each other in a cafe or bar and struck up s friendly conversation. Yeah, I'd say that's a pretty fair prediction.  The man in the hoodie also looks like he's leaning away from the man with the pipe, or like he's getting ready to go. That's a good point, I didn't even think about that. But then maybe he's also just a classy man that feels like he needs his hat on with his suit and pipe.  I'd probably feel a little uncomfortable as the man in the hoodie. I'm not really sure what they're talking about, but the man furthest to the right seems like he's on a roll with some sort of idea or story and everyone else is listening. Everyone looks really relaxed and comfortable. Aw that man looks like he feels a little uncomfortable or shy or something to that degree. I stand like that sometimes when I feel nervous. Yeah that too. But I don't know, his hands are in his pocket, the chair is in front of him, he's a little farther away than everyone else. Yeah I agree. Regardless of body language they all seem pretty engaged in whatever is going on"
215,R_2CTWETNIEUQJ3DT,what happened?
215,R_3n9t2fo12MEIAL8,"Maybe this is a man and his son? The man in the hoodie and the smoking man will pay their checks and leave together. Based on my earlier question, they may head home together, also. I think I would be quite comfortable, if the smoking man was my father. I would love to be able to sit at a counter in a restaurant with my father, as I live far from home. The people in this picture could be discussing anything. I imagine them trying to decide which movie to go watch in the theater. It would appear that there is no convenient place for him to sit down. There is a chair in front of him, but he would be pretty crowded next to the others. I would imagine the mood would be pretty light, there does not appear to be much tension in the room."
217,R_1IWQrJfX3JvWlAJ,Maybe about a sporting event?
218,R_1IWQrJfX3JvWlAJ,"About a job opportunity? So they know each other already before coming here? probably order another drink Seems like they will chat for a while I see a coffee mug and what looks like an espresso machinge but also ashtray I would feel not as interesting as the guy in the hat and pipe. Right? He reminds me of a detective or something. My original thought was the hoodie guy was coming there to hire the detective or something. Looks like group therapy what do you think? Is the guy standing the leader or is he about to sit down? So they are just talking about casual stuff or something serious? He wants to stretch his legs. The person on the couch has their arm across the whole thing. Cant sit there really I would not want to be sitting so close to other people like that. Yeah, maybe they do not want him over there with them. who know Yeah he got up but did not want to miss the end of conversation.  Seems relaxed Just chatting before going back to work or something like that.  Everyone is casual because of their body language. I think they all enjoy talking to each other and are interested "
218,R_xg44bC6oyRiJ333,May be. I think they are just sharing their life experience It looks like a odd palce for job opportunity I think they continue to talk yup yeah agreed. is this a bar or coffee shop? Maybe smoking is allowed in this coffee shop I would feel relaxed looks like they are enjoying their conversation HAHA. That guy looks super cool Yeah from the classic detective novels Maybe the guy in the hood is a suspect Yeah kind of Very hard to tell. Might be just some common room at home or office Looks like he is watching them all I think just casual stuff maybe about the weather Maybe he is tired or he just came in yeah  He is waiting for him to remove his leg or he is about to leave I think so too I think mood is pretty good Nobody looks mad or anything Yeah. They all look calm  They looks like having fun Is this the end?
222,R_21aZaaveNKejSfy,"  because they are just customers at the bar I think they are just out & are both customers at the bar/establishment  they could be friends, maybe they have been there before  I think another person might appear behind the bar I would feel fine  the smoke might bother me a little bit  no one really smokes pipes like that any more unless they are older than 50 years old not sure, it looks like they are at some kind of meeting There is an empty chair in the middle of the room, maybe it's the chair of the person standing up maybe he wanted to be further away from the main person speaking I think it is more serious It looks like a meeting where something is being discussed"
222,R_D1yazAYEODZRvFL,May be Something related to the food I think one is the person working there and the other is the customer I think the customer is complaining something to the worker of course I feel very irritated because I don't like smoking but why they do so? it's not good for health Discussing about the serious matter may be I think he is saying something to others or else taking any decision
235,R_1IWQrJfX3JvWlAJ,"Are they old friends? There is a coffee mug there They will order more drinks probably sweatshirt guy looks like he is there to ask the pipe guy something I dont think they are friends really Feel like I am talking to myself  I would feel pretty normal compared to the guy dressed up with a pipe.  That guy looks like he is an old school detective I feel like he is there to get some sort of info from the pipe guy.  Yeah to see if his wife is cheating on him. I dont know. lol haha yes! Ok, these people are at work or at a group therapy session? maybe in the breakroom? What do you think? Yeah maybe So they are discussing their problems or just sharing stories Looks casual  Well the one person has their arm across the whole couch haha yeah he should probably just walk away now They are clearly making no seating available to him.  I would not want to sit that close to people anyways.  looks like the guys leg is propped on it. but maybe not Looks casual to me and people are interested in what everyone is saying Just cant tell if the guy standing would rather be sitting or if he is just lurking"
235,R_3G1E2kN11NxmQ8o,"drinking beer after work chit chat at the bar ask for a refill how many people smoke a pipe nowadays? akward, he seems uncomfortable lol or hire him its philip marlow the famos detctive or a AA meeting sports talk during a break yea that akward moment when you try to interject into a conversation its the new guy at work except for the seat in front of him friendly yea lurking, wanting an invite to join the conversation"
238,R_1M5qLFZxmceYsUd,"I think they are talking about how good the coffee is or maybe just a friend you know you can have old friends :) some places do  mhm  Ive to europe and some places allow it been* yeah plus who knows maybe the younger man cant stand the smoke anymorwe anymore* right me too... I do not smoke exactly  because even though youre not smoking, it affects you too talking about the long day they have yeah and this is a short 15' break or just to walk around that is what I think or mabe a new coworker and hes being shy the conversation seems to be interesting It is a relaxing because they seem to be having a good time  right but you have to imagine the situation and thats my go for :)"
238,R_31QOiHcypIdUsOx,"maybe it is his grandfather i'm surprised the cafe allows smoking i think it is rare in the states I think they will leave separately most likely if they are aquaintances  maybe he leave before pipe man then I would be annoyed by the smoke  Even if the conversation is interesting the smoke turns me off that I would want to leave  I think they are probably in an office break room maybe they have a few more hours left enough for a cup of coffee or a snack yea it is nice to stretch your legs after sitting a desk maybe he is tired to sitting Or he prefers to stand, I know I generally prefer standing or maybe he is the boss and he just walked into the room I think it is probably neutral, neither tense or joyful hard to tell with no expressions TRUE"
238,R_3NVXiwrpe0ZTR0d,"Hey, 'Sup? "
239,R_3s5K3nM3hIAVgK6,"My first guess is they are discussing business. What do you think? The guy with the pipe does remind me of an old timey decetive!  I was thinking the man with the hood would end the conversation and walk away. Yep, nothing dramatic.  Nervous, I suppose.  Right, guess you could pretend to be overly confident too, like you're somehow smarter.  Looks like they're possibly in a house and weirdly enough that was my guess too. Plan something serious or something light? Interesting. What you think are stairs remind me of curtains. He doesn't agree with the others.  I'm imagining him about to interject, while the others listen to the man on the right.  Agree there  Under control but perhaps a little tense, due to the person standing.  Arrow is up. Nice chatting with you. "
239,R_242UGJjZz877WU1,"It's possible it could also be some kind of interrogation going on.  Right that's why I said interrogation Young man might be asked to accompany the guy with the hat. It's anyone's guess, entirely possible I would feel a little scared Like I have done something wrong and they are on to me.  Trying to plan something Chair, door and stairway remind me of an institution rather than a house He perhaps has encountered something new or has a tip for the group.  He might be sharing the new info The man on the right seems to be their leader They look anxious, surprised and are thinking hard.  Why perhaps a new situation has come up that they need to deal with. "
240,R_00Og1kF8lkKh1OF,"looks like people eating at a diner yes that could be too. have another drink? leave or find someone else to talk with. the smoke from his pipe is bothering me time to go How to handle the next job. lol maybe Is that plans or something they are looking at? He is taking it all in,what they are talking about. lol , yes Involved, some topic that is of interest to all of them. yes, whatever it is the two men look the most interested"
240,R_1239ReYubRCTMJn,"This looks like some kind of old style bar, so I'm going to assume they are men chatting about their workday.  Smoking in bars and a pipe probably at least twenty years ago. I don't think anything will happen.  I think everyone will just keep talking until the bar closes. Pretty much. The guy with the hat might refill his pipe. I wish this guy with the pipe would stop blowing smoke my way. I better finish my coffee.   I think they are sitting in a waiting room and they're probably chatting about their lives.  Maybe one of the guys has built that chair or something.  Everyone seems to be very interested in that chair for some reason. I think he just wants to stretch his legs a bit.  That could be it too.  Maybe he just needs to take in the chair from another perspective.  I think it's genial for the most part.  Everyone looks relaxed. I would imagine the chair took quite a lot of effort to construct.  People need to appreciate that."
241,R_sLFZkGgrBH4oa1r,"I think they're a father and son hanging out at a bar Nah, hoodie's hair is too flat on top haha Maybe a job interview for the CIA? Pipe man is going to slide him an exploding envelope and ask if he accepts his misson Nah, I think he's the guy who gives out missions to secret agents If I were hoodie, and I was gonna get a secret mission, I'd be stoked.  That's fair.  That makes a lot of sense actually  I'd hope it was asking me to steal the declaration of independence though That for sure looks like an intervention for someone with a drinking problem.  well that makes one of us haha.  Pulled shades, people sitting in a circle. one person hunched over looks familiar to me Because he's uncomfortable telling his friend to chill with the drinking Oh man, are you a bot?  Okay me either. Just checking Tense.  Yeah for sure. Nobody looks happy there That's about accurate for an intervention.  Right before someone starts crying you too"
241,R_2e816JyDXY4l33S,"looks like fred from scooby doo with a hoodie, needs to hire a private investigator to spy on daphne wait, so that's the story we're on now? hoodie man can't be inspector gadget i probably wouldn't care either way, assuming this is something I do regularly, its just another job. maybe its the first, like kingsman secret service that kid had a hoodie probably, he was just a punk at first they have no mouths to talk about anything. i haven't been to an intervention to know that that's what it would look like ""for sure""  ""we're all disappointed in you, bob"" its his human right to stand quite the judgmental server. leave the black haired man alone i bet they'll want us to suggest he should have an intervention for his standing problem me? no. assuming an intervention, serious i have no mouth, but i must scream oh, arrow, guess that's it, good luck then"
242,R_qEMKx8hjhlLcCFH,"Hello Ithink they are talking about life in general.  They are discussing their wives and jobs.  What about you?  The man with the pipe is explaining to the guy in the sweatshirt how marriage is work and you have to keep at it.  Hello?  Are  you there? I think after this discussion is over, the man in the hoodie will finish his drink, pay the bartender and leave while the man with the pipe will continue to sit awhile, order another drink and think about his life.  Excuse me? I am communicating.  I need you to communicate with me. This is a group venture.  What do you mean Hi If I were the man in the sweatshirt I would feel a bit wiser having learned from this older man with experience.  I would leave the place with more to think about and a different perspective than when I arrived.  What do you think What would you feel? The people in this picture are talking about some issue that they are there for support of.  What do you think They appear to all be males, in a common place, with no food or tv in front of them, so I get the impression that they are not there for fun The guy with the arm out seems to be talking seriously So maybe a group for support of issues.  He may be the moderator or maybe he just arrived He also may have been upset by the discomfort and maybe he is standing up defensively But, why do you think the man is standing? Tense intense you have no different takes?"
242,R_3MaMszzonfKgAqD,communicate I do not know if holla hi you're right some of the work will be no they fix everything Agan things well I almost did not know it must be like that let's leave like this
243,R_3lS6lWoltV4kUW7,"I would assume they are talking because they are facing one another. If they weren't talking at a bar, they'd be looking forward instead That's definitely possible.  Either they will continue to talk or one of the men will leave. They guy in the hoodie looks like he as a coffee/tea in front of him. Or the guy in the hat will leave. That is definitely possible as well.  Maybe the coffee mug is empty, as there is no steam coming from it.  Annoyed that the guy is smoking. LOL.  Who allows indoor smoking anywhere except maybe a casino? Good point. Maybe the meeting is an interview? But who wears a hoodie to an interview and who would smoke in an interview? Their issues? It looks like a therapy group. The guy standing looks like the group leader. The room doesn't look like a living room or rec room. It looks like an office of some type. Excellent point! The group looks relaxed, since the person on the sofa has their arm extended across the back of the sofa and everyone else's body language is relaxed. He's the leader. Or his back is stiff and he's standing up. He's got his hands in his pocket but seems dressed professionally as previously pointed out by my partner. Yes. The guy to the left of the guy standing is facing the guy to the right.  To me, it looks relaxed. Great input, Partner! Thanks for working with me! As for why, the body language is open for everyone.  Thanks! "
243,R_27JNo3wZArk1nXs,The guy in the hoooded sweatshirt works for the guy with the pipe? The guy with the hooded sweatshirt will pay and leave maybe to run an errand. True they might leave together Yes.  Why is he smoking inside? Maybe he is the owner? Could be Yes Maybe learning how to give positive feedback since no one is in the chair. They are dressed professionally also The chair looks pretty uncomfortable so back issues possible The two on the right seems very engaged I think the guy with the hands in his pockets doesn't agree with the two guys sitting You are a good partner as well
244,R_2s7JsOPavp0BLwK,"They are just being friendly and making small talk, I imagine. Oh, I assumed they were strangers just making conversation. They might know each other... they do seem to be turned all the way in toward each other. I like your idea. They are friends or colleagues chatting at a coffee shop! I think they'll just continue talking until they pay their bill and leave. It seems pretty casual. Oh, if it's a coffee shop, they probably already paid their bill. The more I'm looking, the more I think this is a bar. There are ash trays in a few places. In either case, I think you're right! Yeah it's not super accurate but I think that's what it's supposed to be. Regardless of whether I knew this person or not, I'd be annoyed if someone was smoking this close to me, especially if we were trying to have a conversation. Yes that part is very weird. I might wonder where he is going after this that he is dressed like that! Wow, this is confusing. It looks like a chair to me, but no one is sitting in it. And the two men on the right look like they are crouched or kneeling by it. The only way I can believe this scene makes any sense is if it's an acting or improv class haha. The guy on the couch is watching and everyone else is acting a scene out in front of him. ;-) I guess the walking guy might be entering, but why are those other two not seated? I really have no idea! I'm at a loss. Yeah he wanted to make a point, I like that. I'm not sure why the others seem to be talking to his empty chair though. OH maybe they are putting the chair together I don't see tools but sometimes they don't really require that Exactly! I think maybe they are all discussing the next step in assembly, so they are probably all thinking... there's probably some htoughtful energy Yeah except couch person who is taking a total break haha Ooooh or looking at the instructions"
244,R_CeuqCeljX5zdhId,"It kinda looks like they are at a coffee shop, so maybe talking about work? Do you think they're strangers or friends? Sounds good Maybe the smoking guy will put out his pipe so he can eat or drink? Oh, you're right. So not an espresso machine but a beer tap? I like that I might wonder if I was under dressed? My ""friend"" is wearing a full suit, hat and smoking a pipe haha Yeah, i'd be annoyed by that too And the pipe is way overdoing it in general Does that look like a screen to you? or a chair, maybe? Maybe the walking guy is about to sit down, so maybe they were talking about him haha I could see that Maybe he had to stretch his legs or he wanted to make a point That is super weird Like an Ikea chair haha I'd imagine laid back, they're all sitting really close Couch person is VERY relaxed Maybe checking their phone with their left hand"
245,R_1MYvlPGcJGbkpi0,Arranging for a hit  Just a wild guess  Perhaps it is the mans son and they are meeting for a drink  The hooded sweatshirt guy is going to take a sip of his coffee  I see that creep too lol Lol. Fined by the local government of course for repair money on local roadways  Interviewing at Starbucks. Much busier  Probably ready for a cigarette after my cup of coffee.  Lol. Inspector gadget  Oh maybe it’s a meeting for a boxing match. Under the table illegal stuff  Right!  AA meeting  Lol lol. I am dying  I like the chair interrogation better.  Where are their facial features. Creepy as well  The collar sweater look is so 90’s Beverly Hills 90210 He has a serious case of hemorrhoids.  Only white ones though  Are those indoor hurricane shutters l?  That kneeling pose is awesome  The mood....umm...intense  Everyone looks on edge and uncomfortable especially that empty chair  He is in charge. 
245,R_3qKU1rgvkc8YNt2,"Hmm. What makes you think that? It looks like it's at some sort of cafe, judging by the cups and the machinery there some creeper is watching them Hooded sweatshirt guy takes a sip, man with pipe gets in trouble for smoking indoors unless those are bubbles lol where is the barista I'd feel strange talking to a detective who stepped out of the 1950s also, ready to throw hands with that creeper watching us dude needs to mind his own business That's a good one they are interrogating a chair seriously, I was thinking AA meeting too lol blank faced statue-people ""tell us who sat on you. we can bring them to justice right now, if you just cooperated."" He is prejudiced against chairs this picture gets weirder the longer that I look at it we've got two dudes kneeling at a chair, a guy on a couch, and another one standing up is this a cult thing? Yes, very intense except the guy on the couch is very calm about this They're all ready for a bathroom break after 10 hours of interrogation"
246,R_2ZDJaJ3F3OGHo1Y,"Hello I think they are discussing what drink to get they look like they are at a bar Yes that would seem right I agree that it could be a business deal Or possibly just nonchalant chatting, but it seems to have purpose behind it I think they will drink their drinks and then wrap up their conversation Exactly, that is spot on I think I would feel fine  I would want to participate in a deal Yes, the body language makes it look like they are relaxed I think that they are talking about something very important The body language makes them look like they are focused A study group is probably right Yes they do He may just need to stretch, but he may disagree with something that is being said Yes If he is just getting ready to leave then it is relaxed, if he is up out of opposition then it is a tense room I think so So I would go with relaxed as well"
246,R_PvwmlCfbvh6Qld7,"Hi Agreed definitely looks like a bar or a coffee bar so maybe a business deal? They will shake hands after finishing a business deal and leave after they finish their drinks agreed they both seem relaxed Maybe they are in a study group?  Or work group? They all seem interested and attentive yes or maybe he is about to leave, but waiting to hear the end of the discussion yea agreed, although they all seemed relaxed"
247,R_XAPyWdzoGy39mg1,"Hello Casual  dinners who hit it off? Being asked not to smoke indoors? You might be right where guy with the pipe is a law enforcement officier Yes He might  be ready to leave first as he lit up a pipe Not too comfortable to continue a long conversation with a stranger,  how about you? Brainstorming about a work project? Jury deliberating a case Haha, looks casual too Very possible and his chair was too close to other guy opposite him to sit down Haha That sounds very plausible "
247,R_322Oz0NhVfDI6hK,"Hello, I think it is more of a interrogation scenario . What do you think? The guy with the hat will get up maybe?  And walk about because he has payed him bill and he is ready to leave  Or he may get up and handcuff the guy  I would feel a bit nervous only if I am guilty.  True, uncomfortable for sure.  Planning a vacation ?  They do seem to be wearing business attire so yes yo may be right.  yes I think yo may be right about the work project He just walked in He may have to go somewhere so there was no time for him to be feeling comfortable  They are calm because of the topic their are talking about also because they are close to each other, either friends or good co-workers"
248,R_3Pq5V8yGYflSHHr,"I think they are talking about work.  Yep sounds good to me to Lunch meeting at a bar I think they will grab a drink and discuss a meeting they have this afternoon. Possibly a sales pitch?  Oh yes, I think waiting for a table to get ready is correct  Yep I agree I would feel good if I were this man in the hooded sweatshirt.  I don't think he's mad/upset at all lol I'll go with what you say They are talking about a family crisis.  Maybe they are all related and something bad happened in the family Yes, waiting room as one of their family members is in critical condition He's nervous Agreed Very somber Yes lol"
248,R_2PbMMfRYdnhzTOB,"They appear to be at a bar. lunch meeting at a bar! sounds good to me. They must be waiting for their table to be ready. ok, so next they will head to the table. I would be mad that this hombre is smoking inside of a bar. I don't think this meeting would go well. hah,I don't think we have to agree on this one do we? oof, this is tough my first thought is sitting in a waiting room thoughts on the waiting room? is a family member in a hospital? great, agreed He is clearly too distraught to sit quite somber well this one was easy, lol that looks like a completion code"
249,R_2xE0ng9wwyU29HP,He bought him a drink Yeah I guess Lol yeah. Or why he is allowed to smoke there Yea Because it is morning in the coffee shop. Need to go to work soon Would wonder why this guy is smoking a pipe so early in thr morning Feel a bit awkward Yup Yea. Everyone got black out drunk and trying to pieve it together Yea. Just got up No. Hope not too many Yeah. Everyone is hungover and tired
249,R_1pncL9Ez7Ndsvnc,"Looks like a coffee shop so yeah They might talk about work Although I don't onow what a guy witha pipe and a hat like that would do for a living haha After that they'll probably go on with their business  We need to say why  Yeah that sounds good But wouldn't care cause it's too early in the morning to think about those stuff lol About last night  Hahaha yeah connect the dots Maybe cause he just came, give the man a break .. Do you remember how many pictures do we have to do ? Yeah haha Heated cause they have an argument of who drank the most Yup"
250,R_2tDwFSidJTsW03s,They might be talking about their day.. or maybe the man with the pipe is a detective could be! good point They will probably go their separate ways.. or that lol try to go and cover up his crime a little more If he is a detective I would feel nervous even if I didn't commit a crime yes.  wonder where they are that he can smoke inside yes probably or maybe an AA meeting Maybe this is the same guy with the hood and his crew of criminals and they are discussing how to further cover up yes he looks a little uncomfortable i think the mood is likely pretty tense if they are involved in a crime then they all have to trust each other and probably at least one will mess up with that many people involved
250,R_1E6eucNcICPTOdW,"I think so too they seem to know each other maybe they are firends and is questioning the hooded man? but the hooded man seems relaxed they continue to talk if they are firends but if one is detective , the other one will try to go good idea murder parteners me to and a little scared but if they are friends I will feel relaxed and ask him about its pipe hmm good point maybe he is telling him that he is not allowed to smoke inside talking about a trip or planing something or that is like they have some paper on the table. like a map or document yeah and the black hair guy just join them that is why he is standing or wants to leave probably is the killer tense yes they surely are up to something the black hair one seems that will mess things up"
251,R_3CZrVPVUHLN9fIP,"they are talking business? could be, or maybe father/son chat? out for coffee during day for break, maybe problem thinking now teacher, student, -go back to class? okay, sound right now what, back to streets  rah feeling grateful that more experienced person is giving his take on situation trying to figure out work problem or could be teachers chatting might be an observer, or late to the discussion right as mentioned, serious?"
251,R_1iffEn9LvfOpaz2,"the guy with the hat is questioning the guy with a hoodie on what kind of business do you think they are talking? oh yeah, that could be it. I still think the man with the pipe looks like a detective. Maybe the younger guy is working unercover  i suppose. go team! haha ok partner, your turn yeah i think so too they look so serious with their body language so its not like they look like they are having a fun chat yeah he looks a little awkward / uncomfortable with his hands in his pockets i think they are serious but also bored"
252,R_1ewR58Lwi3dCziv,"the man with the pipe could be private investigator yes same, or why the guy hasn't turned around discussing details to an upcoming party they all look calm, guys hands are in his pockets he is listeningto the guy sitting on the couch with his hand out private discussion, looks very cocerning"
252,R_3G7crpj2E1vAeLH,"They are either co-workers or the non-smoking guy is asking why the piper to stop smoking The non smoker will leave because the smoker will not stop smoking Upset that the smoker would not stop smoking Trying to get the guy sitting down in front of the chair to calm down, since the guy standing up feels threatened by him He may be leading a discussion I think you are right. They all look like they are looking at the guy sitting on the couch Well at least two of them It seems like a serious discussion rather than a light one Blinds are closed. Door is closed. Looks like a private discussion"
260,R_3fIhUkA6W09Qvzf,"I think they are talking because they know each other where is my partner?  I think they will pay their bill and leave. I think that because that is what normally happens after you eat or drink in a restaurant.  I would feel pretty comfortable, because hooded sweatshirts are comfortable.  They are talking about football.  because he's coming back from the bathroom I think the mood is jovial because football is fun to talk about. "
264,R_27pP64SVDZJ4NQY,HELLO
265,R_1C9E3GUyylkJVdC,"It looks like an old diner to me. It reminds me of older films where a detective is talking to someone. Possibly, if they do they have different types of clothes.  Maybe one of them is ""undercover"" I imagine they will both leave. Yeah, maybe. After they leave he might start doing that work. He could be a PI for the hooded guy That'd be a bummer. If that's the case I wonder if the man would go back home when they left. Depending on what they're actually doing he would probably feel differently.  That's very true. He also could feel like he's ""getting the weight off his shoulders"" if he's talking to a detective I would hope if it was very bad information he wouldn't tell him in such a public place.  I wouldn't like that. They could be talking about school. Oh, it does. Their arms look a bit aggressive. The guy on the chair doesn't seem to care at all. I'm not sure why it just reminds of a 60's school yard. I feel like he might just be walking up on the argument if that's what it is He could also just prefer to stand. Maybe they're looking over a paper and he can't see sitting down I agree he might not want to get too close.  I think it might be negative due to the way their hands are. The guy in the chair is pretty relaxed or he seems relaxed"
265,R_1DTKF3XF0ut8vsi,"yeah I agree Maybe those two work together? yeah the guy with the hat looks like a detective lol its dick tracy maybe they are discussing some work the detective is going to do for the man in the sweater that's what I think maybe the guy's wife is cheating on him he might feel relieved to know he is going to find out what is going on He might feel sad if the PI gave him some negative info yeah you're right looks like the two on our right could be arguing about something yeah I agree it could be at school their hairstyles are older that's for sure If they are arguing, he might not want to get too close maybe, or he might be looking for something in his pockets tense agreed I agree, they might not be arguing, it could be more of a problem solving situation"
266,R_1GV3QT9qiyVxJJ2,They are discussing the weather Or maybe a business deal They may get into an arguement.  Perhaps one or both of them are drunk. I would be feeling annoyed at the other guy They are having a causal conversation about their neighbors and friends. He was walking through the neighborhood and saw the others and stopped to chat It is laid back and casual because these people are all old friends.
266,R_1QhXQXPYbAC29rK,They are talking about the women They will start arguing I would feel kind of hot! lol about old times I think so seems resonable Maybe he just enjoy standing up Thats reasonable I think so too
267,R_1nVLNgBhRWelOFn,"They both came to the bar alone and started chatting to pass the time Maybe the man with the pipe is a detective and is asking the man some questions Hello, is anyone there They will order something to eat, because it looks like they haven't ordered anything yet Why do you think they will argue, about sports? Seems possible Ah that does seem reasonable Is it a bar or a cafe though Well I'd be annoyed if some guy was arguing about sports with me and more annoyed that some guy was smoking in front of me, giving me second hand smoke I'd also wonder why the guy was so well dressed  Perhaps I'd feel a bit self conscious Looks like a family gathering of sorts, perhaps talking about their children and/or careers Hm seems reasonable He's getting ready to leave soon Maybe he was sitting for a while and wanted to stand up to stretch his legs If it's about politics it's probably an argumentative room because no one can discuss politics calmly usually If it's about their kids and or careers probably a relaxed, nostalgic mood mood* not room"
267,R_1kNyoLQyje0VGfI,yes They are talking about sports They will start arguing and ge drunk get Because the other team is better lol TRUE He is a professional about politics Maybe he like standing Thats reasonable good reason I agree
268,R_26mSnu8WsMtROPX,"they're talking about a business deal i think possibly  or the guy in the hooded sweatshirt may own the man with pipe money #gangsta lol they'll shake hands agreed maybe new picture will provide more clues would feel ordinary to me yeah i would be taken back if that were the situation wouldn't really bother me, i'm a cigar smoker myself haha or intervention yeah haha he's the enforcer the leader of the pack #dab most likely i think there is tension, they all look to be a little concerned just by body language yup agreed"
268,R_p4qEHgLRv0gsdjP,"It could be, or perhaps they just met and are making initial introductions. It's a coffee shop it looks like, so it makes sense they met there for some kind of meeting. True, maybe the guy is asking, where's my money? ;-) I think they continued to sip at their drinks, discussing whatever they were discussing. Maybe they ordered refills, or maybe they left.  Hard to say. Unless he's trying to get his money! Then he might be angry! hha I would think he'd be annoyed by the pipe smoke, I mean who likes having smoke in your face? hah! Looks like a conspiracy meeting to me. haha Yeah, that's true. Which one is getting intervened on though? The guy on the right I guess. They are saying ""Bill, you need to stop smoking cigars!"" :-p He's the serious one! nod haha He's giving him the stern dad looks. Either way, it looks like it was serious. Yeah, everyone has body language suggesting they are focused on the guy on the right."
270,R_1LkAtwsd6iimaGG,"I feel like they may be talking about something serious.  I would definitely buy that he's getting interviewed!  I feel like the guy in the hoodie will go back home to his crappy apartment and the guy with the pipe will boss somebody around.  I can get behind that. His shoulder's so high, he looks really uptight!  Are they all just staring at the empty chair? Ah, so it was an intervention type situation. They all look like parents to me! I feel like he's not in agreement with what's going on.  I agree!  I think it's very tense.  Haha, definitely yes!"
270,R_2R3Wn7UHfZTYiaB,"The guy with the pipe is interviewing the guy in the hoodie. Maybe he witnessed something. The hoodie guy looks a bit apprehensive about it. Their voices will escalate in disagreement lol yes for sure.      Okay so we have an uppity newspaper reporter interviewing. I think he feels apprehensive and wants to leave as soon as possible. Now I am curious what is going on? How they are going to get a teenager back under control. The just got up and walked out. Yes, the best scenario. I think he agrees with the teenager and is trying to sway the others. I think the mood is high tension and the parents are probably wrong and they know it. lol"
271,R_1i4DpQsg0xxfiqu,The man in the hat looks evil They look like they are in a crime scheme Yup. The guy in the sweatshirt probably is the one getting the drugs Ohhh. True. :O Undercover cop? I would feel threatened.. The guy in the hat looks like some crime boss or something. I think I would just run and hide. They could be discussing about a business The guy sitting on the right seems like the leader or something. Or the planner He probably doesn't like sitting haha Maybe he just came into the discussion. Like he just walked in. It looks like serious businesssss I feel like the one sittingin the long sofa and the guy standing up are too relaxed for this. The guy to the right who is standing is a good listener. It seems like a civil environment to say the least.
271,R_3lQ473EttpZ1Igh,"Yes, he looks a bit shady.  It could be a drug deal, or planning some crime The man in the sweatshirt seems to be pulling away from the guy in the hat. Maybe the hatted man has a weapon showing under the jacket He could be threatening the hoodie person Or, the hatted man is a cop and is speaking to the hoodie man. Yes, perhaps. I bet the hoodie person will back off or run next. I would be a bit scared of the man in the hat.  Agreed. There is most certainly a conflict brewing.  Good call! Maybe a mafia kind of man. Scary.  Could still be hiding that gun under his coat.  I would definitely feel threatened, scared.  This image looks like a intervention of some type.  Or maybe a work discussion Sort of a brainstorming meeting for ideas.  They could be discussing some new project or venture.  I think he is standing because he is annoyed at something.  He has his hands in his pockets, like he's frustrated.  The others don't seem to be paying him much attention.  I think the mood in the room is tense. Although the person in the front seems to be relaxed. The others are in some type of discussion. Whether it is heated or just energized is hard to say. "
272,R_1JY2BthjcD6mcyA,"i think they were talking about some black market dealing what happen? they would leave the place. and return to there underworld office  may be i am one of his agent. i may talk about our next drug deliverers  and about the mess with FBI they were planning something. it on robbing or murders   he is listening the plan, i don't think their will be any intention "
276,R_2zBbFn9lio7drNP,"hello hello hello i think they are in bar they are very aggressive  he is very aggressive  i think next moment is beating each other yes yes expect some firing  yes some bad dealing going,  defiantly i firing some one if disagreement   simply chating yes important conversition  maybe work related conversation yes maybe he is standing like tester  may be discuss about game or work related  yes not series football? yes bye"
276,R_2uJW5UKp8Movioa,hi i think they're having a business meeting yes the man with the pipe looking important i suppose they seem serious maybe they will have a disagreement and begin shouting i don't think it would come to blows neccessarily maybe....if the disagreement became heated they seem like important enough people to maybe carry weapons i would feel threatened the man in the suit seems to be more important than i am probably richer and more selfish it's probably a bad negotiation yes perhaps maybe a somewhat physical disagreement a casual conversation although they seem to be at work cuz of the clothes maybe they are on break maybe they're talking about a football game important? perhaps he's tense needs to stretch his legs like tester? testing what? i think the mood is mildly serious not too serious because the guy on the couch is just lounging i think it's more a game like a recent match something that people get involved in but not incredibly serious like a problem at work football sure
277,R_1IQ7i8YbL3LA82F,hai hi hello
